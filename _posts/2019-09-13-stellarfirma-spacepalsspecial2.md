##### [Rusty Quill Gaming podcast theme]

#### HELEN

Hello, and welcome to the Rusty Quill Gaming Podcast. It is I, Helen Gould, being poured into your ear holes right now.

__[Lydia giggling]__

#### HELEN

You are--__[laughs]__

#### TIM

Into your ear cups!

#### HELEN

Oh, yes!

#### LYDIA

Cup your ears!

__[Helen laughs]__

#### BEN

Well, I'm Ben Meredith.

__[Helen laughs]__

#### ALEX

I'm Alex Newall.

#### LYDIA

I'm Lydia Nicholas.

#### TIM

And I'm Tim Callum Tyler Meredith.

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### ALEX

And I'm noticing we're all close to the mic now.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Oh, we're so close.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Ohh, in your ear holes.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* It's radio silk.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* This is gonna be *so* unpleasant.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Yes.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* I am so *fluid*.

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

Oh, no!

#### HELEN

Speaking of fluid, that is the main goal of what we're trying to do.

#### TIM

Oh yeah!

#### LYDIA

Yaaaaay!

#### BEN

But not blood!

#### TIM

Not blood! __[laughs]__

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Hopefully not blood. We are playing Vast & Starlit by Epidiah Ravachol. We... are about to have a team meeting, possibly? We do not know.

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### BEN

Well, Alex gets to define a scene.

#### LYDIA

The stakes are *admin*.

#### ALEX

No no no, I haven't been in a scene. It's passed from whoever's in a scene, I thought.

#### BEN

Ah, no, it's--you go around in a circle.

#### ALEX

Oh, do I get to define a scene?

#### TIM

You're round the horn.

#### HELEN

Yeah!

#### LYDIA

Yeah, you're in charge.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* You don't have to define yourself in it but--

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* OH! Oh, the--

#### LYDIA

Yeah, you--

#### ALEX

--mag-boot's on the other foot now!

#### HELEN

__[laughs]__ Yes. This is turn based. The last person to have a turn was Lydia and--

#### BEN

Unfortunately--

#### HELEN

--you can't see the table so, you know, anyone could be next but it's actually Alex next.

#### ALEX

Is it always two people or can it be more?

#### HELEN

It can be however many you want.

#### ALEX

Okay, in which case I would suggest a team meeting involving... everyone except Shmerr.

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

And I would suggest that is at the base of the tree. So not deep down where the pit is necessarily, but where the real guts of the "engine", in inverted commas, are. For everyone to discuss the current water crisis and how to deal with it.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### ALEX

I'll--I'm not there.

__[Lydia and Helen laughing]__

#### BEN

So, I've set up a whiteboard.

__[laughter]__

#### BEN

Yes, and I am striding side to side in front of it, trying to poke at things with a stick. I don't know how people are listening. But...

#### LYDIA

I'm perched on the white board. And the white board is slightly reflective, so I'm leaning...

__[Ben laughs]__

#### LYDIA

...down into it and I can see myself, and I'm *pecking* furiously at... my reflected image in the white board.

#### TIM

I'm hunkered in a corner, pointedly putting mints into my mouth one after the other.

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

*(slowly* *and* *deliberately)* Nom--

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Nom, nom.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* --nom, nom.

#### HELEN

I have retracted my limbs and I look just like a metal box in front of--__[laughs]__

__[Alex laughs]__

#### HELEN

But I am paying attention.

__[laughter]__

#### HELEN

This is my listening state.

__[laughter]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Peck! Peckpeckpeck. Peck peck!

#### BEN

And you just see Schmee sort of floating outside the--looking through the porthole.

#### HELEN

Shmerr.

#### TIM

Shmerr. Shmerr.

#### BEN

Shmerr!

#### LYDIA

Shmerr.

#### HELEN

Shmerr, Schmee, who cares?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Peck.

#### SHMERR

I agree. If it could just be Sh, it'd be quicker. More efficient.

__[laughter]__

#### UNAL

So, the way that we're going to find this scanner--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Peckpeckpeck!

#### UNAL

--is we are going to, uh, divide the ship into four quadrants--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Peckpeckpeck!

#### UNAL

--and we're each going to sweep a quadrant! And that way we can cover four times the ground as fast...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Peck!

#### UNAL

...as that... happens!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Peckpeck!

#### UNAL

So! Moving on. Once we make contact with the scanner, we need to develop some sort of way to communicate with it.

#### WORSHIPER

I will communicate with the scanner.

#### UNAL

Yes. Potentially! If it is mechanical! But it might be bioorganic.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

I must--this--this invader! Peck peck peck! This invader! Peck! This--this--I need to deal with him first.

#### LYDIA

Starts violently attacking--

#### UNAL

This... is your reflection!

__[quiet chuckling]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Oh! That's a matter of opinion.

#### UNAL

Allow me to illustrate!

#### BEN

The section that you're pecking, I get my white board marker out and just colour it in so that it becomes not reflective anymore.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep. __[beat]__ Well done.

__[laughter]__

#### UNAL

The invader is defeated! And this is why I should be in command of the army!

#### PILCHARDS

Now, I don't wanna burst anybody's bubble, but I've been having a little think in the corner. __[beat]__ Yum yum yum.

__[Alex laughs]__

#### WORSHIPER

Please contribute.

#### PILCHARDS

Now, this sweepin' system, *lovely* as it is and well done Cakey... I think perhaps there is a quicker way.

#### UNAL

And what would you think that would be?

#### PILCHARDS

Wh--

#### UNAL

Also, can I have a mint?

#### PILCHARDS

Ahh, I've eaten them all, I'm sorry. Num num num.

__[Alex and Lydia chuckling]__

#### ALEX

Pops the last one in afterwards!

#### TIM

No, really slowly just brings it up to his mouth, places it on his tongue, and just draws his tongue back into his mouth.

__[Alex laughing]__

#### BEN

How long is your tongue?

#### TIM

Twooooo feet.

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

This just takes a while!

#### TIM

And there's a little clapping noise that goes "tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk."

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

Num num num.

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Why must we go scanterin' and scamperin' about this ship, like rocks dropped down a flight o'stairs, when we could just ask the ship itself, y'know?

#### UNAL

Right, very good! Ship! Where is your scanner?

#### PILCHARDS

You can't--*(laughing)* you can't just yell at the ship.

#### UNAL

I can, and I am!

#### PILCHARDS

__[laughs]__ Well, 'ave a go, we'll see what 'appens.

__[Lydia chuckles]__

#### UNAL

SHIP! Reveal your secrets, where is your scanner?

#### SHIP

Hello.

#### PILCHARDS

Aww, damn. __[chuckles]__

#### SHIP

How can I... be of assistance?

#### UNAL

Where's your scanner? We need to find a... comet. To feed you! Water?

#### LYDIA

__[laughs]__ "Not a comet that's for... small computer parts. A water one!"

#### WORSHIPER

You require refuelling. Where is moisture?

#### PILCHARDS

Go on. Give us a clue, boy-o.

#### SHIP

I will... when I can get a word in... edgeways.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

I don't like it. *Squeak!*

#### SHIP

*(simult.)* The scanner...

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* *[indistinct]* I don't--yeah, don't trust him.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeeh! Eee-ee-eee-eee-ee-ee!

#### SHIP

The scanner... can be located... in the aft... manual compartment.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeee?

#### PILCHARDS

Now, is aft the one that's the backwards at--uh, the pointy bit or the front?

#### LYDIA

Just starts furiously--

#### UNAL

Well--

#### LYDIA

--attacking whatever speaker.

#### UNAL

Given that the other one is the *fore*... and the word forward exists, I'm going to guess... the back.

#### PILCHARDS

You don't have to be a ding-dong about it, Urinal Cakes.

#### LYDIA

Attacking.

#### UNAL

Well, my name is Unal and you've refused to call me that so... touché.

#### LYDIA

Just furiously attacking the speaker that the sound came out of.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

EEEEEEEP!

__[chuckling]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeow-ow-ow-eee-eow-eeow-eeow-reh!

#### PILCHARDS

All right then. Perhaps I will, uh, pop down the aft then and find this scanner and, uh, and pop a little comety request into it. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? We like that? Yeah, we like it.

#### WORSHIPER

I will accompany you.

#### UNAL

As will I!

#### PILCHARDS

Aww, it doesn't have to be like a party.

__[chuckling]__

#### PILCHARDS

We can just--like, two is enough. You know, you're needed up here in the--in--in the command room, you know. Like a centre of a brain.

#### UNAL

Oh, yes, very good. Actually, yes, that is a good place for the commander to be! I will think about our next moves and put them down on this white board!

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, please.

#### UNAL

I'm gonna draw some arrows and some grids! It's going to be wonderful.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, I look forward to it.

#### UNAL

Good! I'm glad.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

I'm glad you're getting in the spirit of things, Pilchards!

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah yeah, no, you're a--you're a--a born leader, and I'll follow you to the ends of... my feet. Now. Why don't we pop down the aft of the ship and see if we can find a lovely little box or something.

#### WORSHIPER

I would like to find... a box.

#### PILCHARDS

Or something.

#### WORSHIPER

Or something.

#### PILCHARDS

*(laughing)* Okay.

#### ALEX

*(unsure)* Hot?

#### TIM

*(laughing)* Not for that!

__[loud laughter]__

#### LYDIA

Hot!

#### TIM

*(laughing)* That's not how it goes.

#### LYDIA

Hot.

__[continued laughter]__

#### BEN

Hot.

#### LYDIA

Hot.

#### BEN

It's hot.

#### LYDIA

It's hot.

#### ALEX

Hot.

#### BEN

Hot.

#### LYDIA

Hot.

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* Look, we've all got urges.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Okay.

__[laughter]__

#### BEN

It's hot.

#### LYDIA

Oh, it's hot.

#### HELEN

Okay. We'll resolve that the next time me or Tim... are in...

#### BEN

A scene.

#### HELEN

...a scene?

#### BEN

Cool.

#### TIM

So what happens? I'm not going for this.

#### BEN

I want to see a scene... of Shmerr... on their own--

__[laughter]__

#### BEN

--looking through the porthole at the *progress*...

__[Lydia and Tim laugh]__

#### BEN

...that the Worshiper and Pilchards are making.

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Yeah.

#### TIM

Can I--

#### BEN

As he crawls from porthole to porthole tracking them.

__[Alex says something indistinct through laughter]__

#### HELEN

Can Gaia communicate outside of the ship?

#### ALEX

I'm gonna say nnno?

#### LYDIA

No.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Otherwise I'll break!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Okay, so you're gonna be talking to yourself on the--

#### ALEX

Yeah, I'm fine talking to myself for a while.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### SHMERR

All right, personal diary of Shmerr, day... I'm not sure.

__[Lydia and Tim laughing]__

#### SHMERR

I have found myself at the bottom -- I think it's called the bottom -- of the ship. Unfortunately, my papers remain inside. So I am attempting to communicate... with the crew, through the portholes. They are very much... not listening, that's fine. __[beat]__ So, as the... commander of this vessel--

__[loud laughter]__

#### SHMERR

--it is--it is my duty to ensure that things happen efficiently and sometimes that involves a hands-off method, so I'm told.

__[chuckling]__

#### SHMERR

I noticed that two of them, I never caught their names, are heading somewhere else, so I am going to attempt to follow them.

Diary entry of Shmerr number two: they have made it into a room, which has items within it. That's... good. They are stood very close to one another...

__[Lydia chuckling]__

#### SHMERR

...and they are attempting to... find a thing. As... commander... of this vessel, I approve of this action. I'm glad they are anticipating my orders, and I am sure this will be fine. Oh? Oh, I think one of them might have tripped over... into the other one's arms. Good that they caught them, I'm glad that my crew care for one another.

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### SHMERR

That's a lot of arms.

#### LYDIA

Oo-o-oh!

#### SHMERR

Oh. They--oh, this is, uh--I may have to file an incident report. It appears they may be choking?

__[Lydia and Tim laughing]__

#### SHMERR

Uh, it's--it's okay though. One of them is... apparently helping them out in some w--goodness me, that is a very long tongue.

__[Lydia hoots with laughter]__

#### SHMERR

I believe they may have been trying to look for the scanner? And--it's on the floor. It's between their feet. If they just look down--ooh. No! __[chuckle]__ That's not looking down! Goodness me. Uh, thank goodness it's zero G or someone... would be getting hurt.

__[chuckling]__

#### SHMERR

Um. That's--that's fine. Um, I guess I'll just... tap on the wi--no, they're... they can't hear, that's fine. Ooh, no! One of them's--one of them's picked up the sca--that's not what the scanner is used for.

__[loud laughter]__

#### BEN

Cut!

__[continued laughter]__

#### HELEN

*Ooh!*

#### TIM

*Well.*

#### HELEN

Good grief. Oh, it's my turn to...

__[Alex laughs]__

#### HELEN

...think of a scene. I'm gonna leave that there.

#### ALEX

I think that's really wise.

__[Lydia and Helen laugh]__

#### ALEX

I'm not sure how I became a peeping Tom but here I am!

#### BEN

*(simult.)* I mean, with that voice--

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Hot! Some people like to watch.

#### BEN

With that voice.

#### TIM

*(imitating* *Shmerr)* Oh, no!

#### BEN

That voice is wearing a dirty anorak.

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

Even without your glands you still exuded some fluid.

#### HELEN

Okay. I would like to see Unal and Mr. Squeakington attempting to figure out what the next steps are if the scanner is found.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Well, they're taking a while. Eep!

#### UNAL

Yes, well. Maybe the scanner's well hidden!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Meep! Yeahhh.

#### UNAL

So! Corporal Squeakington.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

How would you find a scanner? Would there be--need to be another scanner? __[gasps]__ We should find the scanner for the scanner! The scanner-scanner!

__[quiet snicker]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

Ship!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ship.

#### SHIP

Yes?

#### UNAL

Is there a scanner for the scanner?

#### SHIP

Of course.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

__[chuckles]__ Well--

#### UNAL

Oh good! Where's that?

#### SHIP

In the fore storage compartment.

#### UNAL

Right! Well let's go there then!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yep! Makes sense.

#### UNAL

We'll find that--we'll find that scanner-scanner in a jiffy!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(laughing)* Yeah.

__[Helen giggles]__

#### UNAL

So! Corporal Squeakington. How are you finding, uh, your enscripted life so far?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Wait. What? I didn't change my name.

#### UNAL

Lieutenant?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

I--w--um--

#### UNAL

Well, Mr. isn't a military rank, so...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

It's my name!

#### UNAL

Okay, Lieutenant Mr. Squeakington?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Is that a promotion?

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Okay!

#### UNAL

Brilliant! Right! Very good, lieutenant. So, how are you--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

What does that make you?

#### UNAL

Me? Uh, well, obviously it's in my name--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(simult.)* You're a lieutenant?

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* --Commander Unal Manspray!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ahh! Is a lieutenant... *better* than a... communal?

#### UNAL

No, commander.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

*(carefully)* No. But it's different. A lieutenant has, uh, different responsibilities. They command a unit!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ah.

#### UNAL

So, how are you finding the command of your unit?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Well, I told you what to do and you did it, so that's great.

#### UNAL

Good managing upwards then!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Squeak! __[Lydia laughs]__ Squeak.

__[chuckling]__

#### LYDIA

As we go past a porthole...

__[Tim laughs]__

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* No--w--uh--

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* ...I *spot* *an* *enemy.*

#### UNAL

Ah, wait!

#### BEN

I colour in the porthole.

__[Tim and Helen laughing]__

#### SHMERR

Aww.

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

The way the light reflected I was attacking myself! But you were--

#### TIM

And as you're colouring it in, you use--a sort of flag like, "Ooh--ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

And then just sort of like, try to peek over the colour and it just--it literally--absolutely blocks you out.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Surrounded by enemies. Eep!

#### UNAL

Yes, well, a good commander knows how to help their lieutenants!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

So, I'm defeating these enemies for you, see.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep! Eep. Eeeh.

#### UNAL

Right!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Meep.

#### UNAL

So.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Scanner?

#### UNAL

Yes, well, I think this might be the--the fore storage cupboard, so let's just...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Hmmmm.

#### UNAL

...open this up here, and...

#### LYDIA

That's--tiny bird--

#### UNAL

That is a lot of sap.

#### LYDIA

--like, is grabbing onto the handle and trying to--*(quietly)* tiny bird.

__[sound of massive metal door being crashed open]__

#### UNAL

Gosh, you're strong!

__[laughter]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

It's the low gravity.

#### UNAL

Right.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

Okay, well let's just--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Also, I--I have a much bigger and more impressive form in a different dimension.

#### UNAL

Ah. Very--v--that's very interesting. Well, you look like a very tiny budgie now, so...

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### UNAL

...quite shocking seeing you just...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(laughing)* I am a... t--t--

#### UNAL

...heft that door completely off of its hinges.

__[laughter]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(laughing)* --tiny, tiny budgie.

__[chuckling]__

#### UNAL

Um--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Don't know my own strength. Squeak!

#### UNAL

Well--y--well, there's quite a lot of sap in there, so I--I don't know if you wouldn't mind, but I--uh--this is the only uniform I've got, and I'd rather keep it... it's not very good for the commander to look dirty, so, if you wouldn't mind going inside and getting the scanner-scanner, that'd be greatly appreciated. I might even give you a commendation.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Oh, is it--is--can I eat it?

#### UNAL

The sap or the scanner-scanner?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Or the commendation.

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Okay!

#### LYDIA

Into the sap.

#### ALEX

I'd say difficult.

#### TIM

Yeah, getting a--

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Yeahhhh.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* --scanner out of the sap.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Sappy, sappy scanner.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Sap locker. Hence the--

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Especially when you're made of feathers!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Yeah, you've got feathers.

#### LYDIA

Yep.

#### HELEN

Yeah, that's gonna--you're gonna get clogged!

#### LYDIA

Just--"oh no!"

#### TIM

Like that film, *The Sap Locker*. You know.

__[Helen splutters with laughter]__

#### ALEX

I want you to know how on-board I am with Helen being in charge: I didn't call that "hot". Could've done.

#### TIM

Could've done.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### ALEX

Trying to help.

#### TIM

Trying to help.

#### ALEX

Team player Alex.

#### LYDIA

Just "difficult".

#### HELEN

Thank you very much.

#### TIM

You did call the last thing "hot" though. It's the--

#### ALEX

It was.

__[Tim laughs]__

#### ALEX

Hence why.

#### HELEN

Apparently, apparently it was.

__[Alex laughs]__

#### HELEN

Timothy, it's your turn.

#### TIM

Oh. *[indistinct]*

#### ALEX

Oh, you've been graduated to a Timo--__[laughing]__

__[Helen laughs]__

#### TIM

Not even my name, I just--__[sighs]__--we find ourselves back in the original meeting room and Deraldio and Worshiper 2X7 have returned... holding the scanner proudly and expecting praise, only to find that everyone has gone.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, this is quite a to-do. This is quite a to-do. We've found it now. We've found it and we're ready to find some--some watery, watery comets and they've all gone. They've all naused off, innit?

#### WORSHIPER

Well, it is time to operate it.

#### PILCHARDS

All right. All right, I'll pass this over to you. It's mechanical like you. It's your kin.

#### WORSHIPER

It is. We are along the same... design lines.

#### PILCHARDS

We'll ha--we'll have a bang on this then.

#### TIM

I hand over the scanner to her.

#### BEN

It sounds like you already have.

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

Eyyyy!

#### ALEX

Whomp whomp.

#### LYDIA

Weowwww!

#### PILCHARDS

Brush it down with this chammy leather. It'll be fine.

__[laugher]__

#### HELEN

Worshiper 2X7 inserts the scanner into a slot like a USB.

#### LYDIA

Oh.

#### TIM

It's what--it's what I was trying to do earlier.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* So you mean you try it once...

#### TIM

*(simult.)* I was just *(laughing)* furiously trying to--

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* ...and it flips around...

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* And you turn it around.

#### ALEX

Oh no, you were right the first time! Flip it back round.

#### HELEN

Okay.

__[quiet chuckles]__

#### WORSHIPER

Moisture detected.

#### PILCHARDS

Ah, wonderful. Where's it--where's--where's it--where is that precious?

#### WORSHIPER

Moisture detected: one foot away.

#### PILCHARDS

Ah, okay, we might need to re-calibrate this.

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Please, you know, I do--I do know I contain moisture but it's not for that! And you know what, I'll just--

#### WORSHIPER

Are you sure?

#### PILCHARDS

I'm pretty sure it stays inside.

#### WORSHIPER

Moisture is multipurpose.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay--you know, but--

#### BEN

*Dangerous*.

#### ALEX

Yeahhh!

#### LYDIA

Dangerous.

#### HELEN

Getting dangerous. __[laughs]__

#### ALEX

The android's discovered that they're all *water* *bags!*

__[Helen laughs]__

#### BEN

I've cut it.

#### TIM

You cut it?

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Yeah. Cut it.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Oh, you've just cut it.

#### BEN

Dangerous.

#### HELEN

Yep.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Oh yeah.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Cut it there.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* I agree.

#### BEN

We'll see how that one ends.

#### TIM

Gah, our relationship has taken some roller coaster turns!

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

You know?

#### BEN

Those well-known whirlwind romance murders.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah.

__[Helen laughs]__

#### TIM

I was in the forest for a long time on my own, so... __[laughs]__

__[chuckling]__

#### ALEX

It's more like a femme fatal error.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Ooooooohhhhhhh.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Aahhhhh.

__[Helen groans]__

#### ALEX

*(muttering)* Femme fatal... *(louder)* I can't make it *parse*--

#### BEN

*(simult.)* No, the idea's solid!

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* --but you know what? It works on the page.

#### BEN

Workshop it.

#### TIM

Could I perhaps--

#### BEN

Come back to us next week.

#### ALEX

I will. I will.

#### TIM

--resubmit *The Sap Locker*, in that case?

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

Consideration further on *The Sap Locker*.

#### BEN

You think you deserve more for the one?

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ No. No, but I'd like more for it.

__[laughter]__

#### HELEN

Lydia.

#### LYDIA

I think that Ben's character will turn up and see the tail end of whatever was happening there.

#### HELEN

Ooh.

#### TIM

Oh, between... between Deraldio and--

#### HELEN

Between Pilchards and--

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

--Worshiper 2X7.

#### TIM

Deraldio Pilchards.

#### HELEN

2X7 is beginning to advance.

__[electric saw noise]__

#### PILCHARDS

Now, let's all calm down, let's all calm down. I have--

#### WORSHIPER

Must acquire moisture.

#### UNAL

Well, yes, that's the mission, isn't it?

#### PILCHARDS

Nah, nah, you don't understand, Ural. You don't understand.

#### WORSHIPER

Additional moisture discovered.

#### PILCHARDS

Now, it's--it's all got--

#### UNAL

Okay, the problem has become very rapidly obvious.

__[Alex and Lydia burst out laughing]__

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah. Yeah. Now, I know you and I don't get on, but I don't want either of us--

#### WORSHIPER

Must acquire moisture.

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* Can we count moisture source--

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* Yeah--well, we should do so from a... comet! From a comet!

__[electric saw winds down]__

#### PILCHARDS

We need to use cold, hard logic on this. This is a very logical being.

#### UNAL

The--the plan! Look at the white board!

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, look at the white board.

#### WORSHIPER

White board does not contain moisture.

#### UNAL

No, but--

#### WORSHIPER

Biological beings.

#### PILCHARDS

Hang on. Hang on, hang on. __[pause]__ Worshiper. Now, sure, do we contain moisture? Yeah! We all know that. That's something we've all come to accept. I'm full of moisture. He's full of moisture. You? Not so much. It'd ruin your chips. But!

__[Lydia chuckling]__

#### PILCHARDS

We've only got a little bit of moisture in each of us. Barely get you a parsec. Barely get you that far. So how 'bout, how 'bout... you... helping us, helping you, get to a much--a much larger source of water. Oh, I don't know, just casting about for ideas, perhaps a comet.

__[Lydia chuckles]__

#### UNAL

Also... I have my old service ray gun.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay. Now you--

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Could we not have seen if my thing had worked first?

__[laughter continues]__

#### PILCHARDS

Before we go straight to the--you did this on my home world! You did--we tried to talk to you, and you were like, *(mocking)* "Also, ray gun", and it was *very* unhelpful.

#### UNAL

A, good impression. B, well, you were all living in dirty holes, so...

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Ooooooooohhhhh!

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* OOOOOHHHHHHH.

#### PILCHARDS

A dirty hole? I'll have you know that dusty is not the same thing as dirty.

__[Alex chuckles]__

#### PILCHARDS

If it's a *dry...* piece of earth, that's not the same thing as dirty. I feel--n--I--please, Worshiper, I'm--well--I'm--gimme a second.

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

This is a--a little tension!

#### TIM

A li--look.

#### ALEX

I feel like Worshiper's stood there by the way with at least *two* circular saws.

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

Out, spinning, good to go. And it's like, "Oh yeah, fair enough. That was completely uncalled for. Yeah."

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

If we are gonna work together effectively as a team, as *much* as it hurts me to say that we might have to, you're gonna have to stop talking that way about me and my people.

#### UNAL

Then you're going to have to call me Unal! *Commander* Unal Manspray.

#### PILCHARDS

All right, I think a détente can be reached. Ural--I've forgotten.

__[laughter]__

#### UNAL

Commander! Unal! Manspray!

#### PILCHARDS

You are Commander Ural Manspray.

#### UNAL

And your holes were positively lovely.

__[Lydia bursts out laughing]__

#### PILCHARDS

*(laughs)* Thank you.

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### PILCHARDS

That's all I've ever wanted a military commander to say to me whilst holding a ray gun in the presence of a killer robot.

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### WORSHIPER

Adjusting... scanner... functions.

#### LYDIA

*(chuckling)* Whoops, I don't want to see this.

#### UNAL

Oh! Wait was it that easy?

#### PILCHARDS

The parameters are shifting! Now, I--I d--I know it--maybe it's a bit of--a bit of--

#### WORSHIPER

Scanning outside of vessel.

#### UNAL

Oh, very good!

#### PILCHARDS

Could I just ask a quick question. Was it my logical work or his gun that made the real difference for you?

#### WORSHIPER

It was boredom.

__[Alex and Lydia laugh]__

#### PILCHARDS

Ahh.

#### UNAL

So both!

#### PILCHARDS

Both.

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### PILCHARDS

High five. Whoa, put down the gun.

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Holster.

#### WORSHIPER

Comet located. Two point five parsecs away.

#### PILCHARDS

Excellent.

#### UNAL

Right. Well, now we need to find the, um--__[snaps fingers]__--cabin.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh yeah.

#### UNAL

Cockpit. Flying place.

#### PILCHARDS

Uh, computer?

#### SHIP

Yes?

#### PILCHARDS

Ah, how you doing?

#### SHIP

Yes?

#### PILCHARDS

Okay. We need to find the, uh, what would you call it, bridge, steering place, wheelhouse?

#### SHIP

Yes?

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, could you tell me where it is?

#### SHIP

The bridge is located... on the bridge.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay. Now...

__[quiet snickering]__

#### PILCHARDS

...as true as that is... could you perhaps tell me where, from here, the bridge might be?

#### SHIP

Up.

__[pause]__

#### PILCHARDS

Well, you know what? We've got an instruction.

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Let's head up to the bridge.

#### UNAL

Yes! We have a heading.

#### HELEN

Right. Cut!

#### BEN

Cut, I think.

#### LYDIA

*Cut!*

__[chuckling]__

__[Helen sighs]__

#### ALEX

I want you to know, I really wanted to, if I was gonna do a computer, not be a generic Newall, completely unhelpful, really annoying NPC.

#### BEN

And yet you do remain Alex.

#### LYDIA

And yet...

#### ALEX

And I--I can't help it!

__[Ben and Helen laugh]__

#### ALEX

It's a real compulsion!

#### TIM

It's almost as if you interact with computers on a daily basis that are kind of like that.

__[laughter]__

#### HELEN

It is now Alex's turn to frame a scene.

#### LYDIA

Mmmm.

#### ALEX

Hmm.

#### LYDIA

Mmmmm.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Mmmm.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Mmmm.

#### HELEN

MMMMmmmmm!

__["mmms" continue, converge, and grow louder/more dramatic, culminating in:]__

#### HELEN

*(a* *little* *tune)* Hmm hm hmmm!

__[Alex bursts out laughing]__

__[quiet wheezing laughter]__

#### ALEX

I am going to frame a scene.

#### HELEN

Mm-hmm?

#### ALEX

Worshiper 2X7 has gone off on a hunt to find Mr. Squeakington, who has now been missing for *hours*, and hours.

#### TIM

*(laughing)* I just remembered that means that you've just--Ural just *abandoned* Mr. Squeak--

#### ALEX

Yeah!

#### BEN

Oh, I was gonna do a bit about--

#### TIM

*(laughing)* You just--

#### BEN

--how I was really sad about having lost my first soldier in action, but we got straight into murder, so.

__[Lydia chuckling]__

#### ALEX

This was my implication, yeah, so.

__[Ben chuckles]__

#### ALEX

Worshiper 2X7 has managed to find Mr. Squeakington exactly where Mr. Squeakington was left.

#### LYDIA

Just... stuck.

#### ALEX

Just...

__[Helen laughs]__

#### ALEX

Just *so* stuck!

#### HELEN

Like 30 centimetres insi--__[laughs]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep! EeeeEEEEEE!

#### LYDIA

*So* *furious!* Such a *furious* little bird!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

MEEEEEE*EEEEE*EEEEEEEP!

#### WORSHIPER

Hello!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Merp?

#### WORSHIPER

Biological organism.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Rrreeeeeeeee!! __[pause]__ *(more* *subdued)* Ee-eerh. Eeerh.

#### WORSHIPER

Do you require assistance?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(grumbly)* Ee-ee-ee-eeooh.

#### LYDIA

That's a swear word in her language.

#### WORSHIPER

I do not understand... your language.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(sulky)* Yes.

#### WORSHIPER

Very well. Extending arms.

__[Lydia makes a dismayed noise]__

__[Helen chuckling]__

__[power saw noises and squelching]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(varying* *shades* *of* *alarm)* OoooOOOOOOOOOh!! Oooh--OOOHHH. AAAAHH! Oooh--! U--u--mmph--mmph mmph mmmph mmph! *(less* *alarmed)* Araaaaahh!

#### WORSHIPER

Budgie retrieved.

__[Lydia chuckling]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(pitifully)* Squeak. So sticky.

#### WORSHIPER

Do you require assistance with your...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(quietly* *and* *pitifully)* Flap.

#### WORSHIPER

...covering... material?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(pitifully)* I need a dust bath.

#### WORSHIPER

Hmmmm...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Not a moisture bath.

#### WORSHIPER

Dust bath.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Dust bath.

#### WORSHIPER

Explain.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

It's a bath. It's made of dust.

#### WORSHIPER

Where is dust?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Umm... in the hole.

#### WORSHIPER

To the hole!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

The hole is dusty.

#### WORSHIPER

I shall assist.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yaaay!

#### BEN

Cut.

#### LYDIA

Tries to fly but is stuck.

#### ALEX

You're taking a sap covered bird into his lovely hole?

#### TIM

Yeah. And--and--and mussing up all my lovely dust!

#### ALEX

Mussing up his dust?

__[Ben and Lydia chuckle]__

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

You wait 'til I get home, buster.

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

I need--need the dust to live!

#### HELEN

Awwww. Cool. Right.

#### LYDIA

Fortunately, I don't have much moisture.

#### HELEN

__[laughs]__ Yeah, it should be a very easy thing to do.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Right. So. We are trying to find the bridge and also bathe a bird in dust.

#### LYDIA

__[laughs]__ Yeah.

#### BEN

Mm-hmm.

#### HELEN

Let's see if we--

#### TIM

Two equally important tasks.

__[Helen bursts out laughing]__

#### TIM

The survival of us all, and the dusting of a bird.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Oh yeah, and Alex's character is somewhere.

#### SHMERR

*(simult.)* Also, I'm here.

__[laughter]__

#### HELEN

Right. We'll see you after the break and see what happens.

#### HELEN

And welcome back to the Rusty Quill Gaming podcast with an *anarchic* model of gaming. So, we are now at... yes, it's--

__[Lydia gasps]__

#### HELEN

--Ben's turn to frame a scene.

#### BEN

Hullo!

#### HELEN

Hello! What do you want to see?

#### BEN

I... want to--I actually--I want to follow this dust bath.

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

Follow the action!

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Oh, yes! That's what the listeners all like.

#### BEN

Yeah.

__[Helen laughs]__

#### TIM

What's going on with this bath? Come on!

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

My feathers, they're so sticky and it is--

#### ALEX

Hot!

#### LYDIA

--so urgent.

__[Helen laughing]__

#### LYDIA

Yeah, well, if you want to cut because it got too hot...

#### ALEX

No no, I cut--

__[Helen and Tim laughing]__

#### ALEX

No no no, let's let this--let this play.

#### LYDIA

That android is getting a lot of action!

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Let this play.

#### BEN

*(simult,* *laughing)* Yeah.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(pitifully)* Please take me to the dust! I'm so... I'm so sticky!

#### WORSHIPER

Pit is reached.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(simult.)* Oh, okay.

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult.)* Shall I drop?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Urgency's a--yes!

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult.)* Dropping.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(simult.)* Please, sa--aaaahhh!

#### BEN

*Thmp.*

#### LYDIA

__[makes a "splat" sound, laughs]__ Yeah. Your thump was better.

__[Helen and Ben chuckle]__

#### LYDIA

*Thmp.*

#### WORSHIPER

Is that agreeable?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Just flutters around in the dust.

#### ALEX

The gentle splat of... sap, spraying out across--

#### LYDIA

Spray--

#### TIM

All over my LOVELY THINGS!

#### LYDIA

Sap is getting everywhere.

#### TIM

And I would say--

#### LYDIA

Shuffling around.

#### TIM

From Worshiper's point of view just a cloud of dust rising out of the pit hole.

__[Alex laughs]__

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

No, you know, you know--__[laughs]__--that thing when swans get in the water and they wiggle their tail.

#### HELEN

Mm.

#### ALEX

Yes!

#### LYDIA

Yeah. How they always wiggle their tail.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

But that's just the budgie, just all over, like--

__[Ben chuckles]__

#### LYDIA

--ohhh, the wiggle of satisfaction.

#### WORSHIPER

One hour remaining of moisture reserves.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ah, but this is very important, and the stakes were really so high.

__[laughter]__

#### WORSHIPER

Worshiper 2X7 moisture reserves.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ah. Well, uh--

#### WORSHIPER

Will power down in T-minus sixty minutes.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Could--could you try dust instead of moisture? Squeak!

__[pause]__

#### WORSHIPER

That is heresy!

__[laughter]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Uh, it's just that--

#### WORSHIPER

NONBELIEVER.

#### TIM

Danger.

#### ALEX

Danger!

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

Dangerous!

#### TIM

Danger, Will Robinson.

#### HELEN

DANGEROUS! __[laughing]__

__[laughter]__

#### HELEN

Oh hey!

#### TIM

*(laughing)* I love so far all of the danger involves you becoming rogue.

__[Helen laughing]__

#### TIM

I'm sensing a theme--

__[Helen still laughing]__

#### TIM

In many ways, isn't the solution to this to chuck you out of the damn airlock?

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

And then we just have a lovely space boat sojourn.

__[renewed laughter]__

#### TIM

Oh, we must save this thing that *consistently* tries to kill us, otherwise it might kill us. Oh, wait. Oh, wait.

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

But we--the tree needs water as well.

#### TIM

The tree does also need water. That is true.

#### HELEN

Yes. Okay, so... Pilchards and Unal are trying to find the bridge, having... become friends.

#### TIM

*(simult,* *dubious)* Mm...

#### BEN

*(simult,* *dubious)* Ehhh...

__[Helen laughs]__

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Found a mutual accord.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Become acquaintances.

#### TIM

Friends of circumstance, should I say.

#### LYDIA

Could we watch it from...

#### BEN

Yeah!

#### TIM

Right, from--

#### HELEN

Yes!

#### BEN

Shmerr's perspective.

#### TIM

*(laughing)* From Shmerr's perspective, yeah yeah.

#### HELEN

Okay. Shmerr, you're watching these two try--attempt to find the bridge.

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### SHMERR

Captain's log: I find myself looking out to the stars, and considering our journey out towards them, not just as a metaphor for the expansion of life and sentience throughout the universe, but also... it's sort of like looking at a big empty spreadsheet. It's just glorious and awe-inspiring.

__[Lydia chuckling quietly]__

#### SHMERR

But I digress. I find myself outside the bridge now, observing my two lieutenants, the one what has all the legs--

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### SHMERR

--and the one who I'm now cheerfully calling "White Board".

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

White Board and Many Legs seem to be getting along. They are efficient, if... somewhat... distant from one another in the room, but I'm sure that is fine. I notice that White Board appears to be spooling up the engines, which is encouraging. Of course, I am quite literally on the outside of a ship, with no way to brace myself against the acceleration--

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### SHMERR

--but I'm sure that they have already considered this--

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

--before they would launch such a massive acceleration in such a way. Meanwhile, Many Legs appears to be at the nav console. In a lot of ways, I--I like to think of Many Legs and White Board as my dream team.

__[chuckling]__

#### SHMERR

It's clear that under my guidance and my, uh, hands-off management--ohh, listen to me! I'm a regular anarchist. Um...

__[chuckling]__

#### SHMERR

They are--they are proceeding in a way that could only be considered exceptional. So, with that in mind, I'm going to actually hold on, under the assumption that I'm going to--__[static noise]__

__[Helen gasps]__

#### TIM

Dangerous.

#### LYDIA

Mmmm.

#### HELEN

Danger?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### ALEX

That was up to you.

#### TIM

We're accelerating and he's on the outside of the ship and he's just about to grab on.

#### HELEN

Ooh! Oh, such danger.

#### TIM

I don't know how the physics of it works. You know, there's no air resistance.

#### BEN

I mean, we're--we're flying a giant tree, so...

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

__[Helen giggles]__

#### BEN

The physics can, uh, can take a hike on this one.

#### TIM

Eh, fair enough.

#### HELEN

Yes, they can.

#### ALEX

Fun fact: as long as he's on the nose of the ship and that's the direction it's traveling, he'll be fine.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, it's fine.

#### TIM

It'll be fine.

#### LYDIA

I was surprised you didn't have them hook up.

#### ALEX

I was very tempted--

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Yeah, I could hear it in your voice.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* --but I also didn't--I didn't want to force that.

#### TIM

No.

__[Helen chuckles]__

#### ALEX

You know. Some romances take time. Some are entirely moisture driven. And others are--are forged in the fires of adversarial...

#### LYDIA

And some happen--

#### ALEX

...conflict.

#### LYDIA

--when you accelerate and then you tumble into each other's arms.

#### TIM

"Oh, I've fallen! Oh, your eyes."

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

I wouldn't want to force it. Let it happen. Let it happen.

#### HELEN

Well, Tim.

#### TIM

I think we should do a scene in the bridge then--

__[snickering]__

#### TIM

--seeing as this--

#### ALEX

*(singing* *"Let's* *Get* *it* *On")* Boww, boww...

#### LYDIA

*(simult,* *joining* *in)* Boww, bowwwwww!

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* *...*bow, bowwwww!

#### LYDIA

*(simult,* *singing)* Bow-bow bow boww!

#### BEN

*(simult.)* It's "date me brother" again!

#### TIM

No.

#### BEN

Tim.

#### LYDIA

*(simult,* *singing)* Bow bow *(laughing)* bowwwwww.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* No. We are not that well-acquainted as characters; it's not going there.

__[Ben chuckles]__

#### TIM

So, uh, Deraldio Pilchards and--I'm generally having a bad--hard time--

#### BEN

Commander!

#### TIM

Commander--

#### BEN

*Unal!*

#### TIM

Unal.

#### BEN

*Manspray!*

#### TIM

It's because I've written it down as "Ural" like the Ural Mountains, so...

#### BEN

It's *Unal* like the *Unal* Mountains.

#### TIM

Like the Unal Mountains. __[chuckles]__

__[Helen laughs]__

#### TIM

Right.

#### LYDIA

Named after those famous mountains.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### LYDIA

Ironically on the planet Urinal.

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

*(mimicking* *Unal)* It causes so much damn confusion!

__[Helen laughs]__

#### BEN

*(as* *Unal)* But it's tradition!

#### TIM

Yeah. So, we have started to engage the ship and accelerate towards our destination.

#### UNAL

I say, did you hear some sort of thump?

__[chuckling]__

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah. There was definitely something clattering across the hull at some point.

#### UNAL

Oh well. Ship. Ship!

#### SHIP

Yes?

#### UNAL

Have there been any hull breaches?

#### SHIP

No.

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* Ah, it was nothing important then.

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* Ah, everything seems fine then.

#### SHIP

All valued crew members are accounted for.

__[laughter]__

#### UNAL

Very good. Thank you!

#### PILCHARDS

All right, well, wonderful. Now, you know what? I do have a nagging feeling that there was something we are forgetting. I couldn't possibly tell you what it is though.

#### UNAL

__[hand hits forehead in realisation]__ Mr. *Squeakington!*

#### PILCHARDS

Mr. Squeakington!

__[Lydia chuckles]__

#### PILCHARDS

What happened? You went--you went up with Mr. Squeakington to find the extra scanner, as you were telling me as we walked here.

__[chuckles]__

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

And you never got to the end of the story. And then you just came back in when we were having a situation with Worshiper. What--what happened?

#### UNAL

Yes, unfortunately...

#### BEN

I take my hat off. Hold it on my chest.

#### UNAL

We lost one.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh no.

#### UNAL

Mr. Squeakington went into the fore storage cupboard...

#### PILCHARDS

Right.

#### UNAL

...and was taken by the saps therein.

#### PILCHARDS

Ah, no. Mr. Squeakington's a feathered being.

#### UNAL

Exactly.

#### PILCHARDS

Well, what did you do about it?

__[pause]__

#### UNAL

Respected... their loss.

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* "I pressed F."

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* As any good commander should. Yes?

#### PILCHARDS

No, that--that--

#### UNAL

Paid my respects.

#### PILCHARDS

You just put your hat back on. Take it back off again.

#### UNAL

Oh, sorry.

#### PILCHARDS

We're not finished.

__[Lydia chuckles]__

#### PILCHARDS

Look, you can't just, like, put a bird in some sap and then go, "Ah, whoopsie daisy."

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

"Aw, I better just walk away then." You have to, like, try and help it out.

#### UNAL

Well, what you forget about Mr. Squeakington is they were an interdimensional being.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

Um, and prior to this, I saw them rip the door of the fore storage cabinet clean off.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah. Yeah.

#### UNAL

So, I thought that they might be able to handle a bit of sap.

#### PILCHARDS

Sure.

#### UNAL

And, uh, I only have one of these uniforms.

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, no, I'm no--I'm noticing an inconsistency in, uh, in--in your account. You're taking your hat off and saying we lost one.

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

But also assuring me that they're fine and it's all fine.

__[laughter]__

#### UNAL

No no no no no no no no no. No, what I mean is... I *assumed* that it would be all fine.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, you just didn't stick around to find out. __[laughs]__

#### UNAL

Well, no. They, they went in...

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

...and I didn't see them again. Thus... killed in action.

#### PILCHARDS

Nah, this is the problem with you. This is the problem with you, mate. This is exactly what we were--what we were having a barney about earlier.

#### UNAL

Oh, I don't recall.

#### PILCHARDS

You--you don't respect people, do you?

#### UNAL

What? No!

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* You don't respect me.

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* The way--d--of course I do!

#### PILCHARDS

You don't respect Mr. Squeak--

#### UNAL

I do--the hat's off.

#### PILCHARDS

Well, yeah--

#### UNAL

The hat's off!

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Look, taking your hat off whilst we--absolutely--

#### UNAL

Do you want me to lower the hat?

#### PILCHARDS

Well, drop it on the floor and stamp on it as far as I care.

#### UNAL

No, I will never do that to my hat!

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

No. Take--

#### UNAL

That's a symbol of my office!

#### PILCHARDS

That will be--that would--that would prove to me that you do actually care *even* *the* *slight* *bit* about your fellow crew members. Take off your hat, throw it on the floor, and step on it.

__[Lydia gasps]__

#### PILCHARDS

And if you do that, maybe I can push past the fact that you 100% abandoned your crew members at the *slightest* sign of even a *little* bit of adversity!

#### UNAL

Well... then you'll have to join... __[unhappy sigh]__ my hatless army.

#### PILCHARDS

You mean I have to take off my hat too?

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay.

#### TIM

I gently reach up to my stylish bowler.

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

Which you've been wearing this whole time.

#### TIM

It's half rotted.

__[Helen laugh-groaning]__

#### UNAL

W--we should drop the hats together.

#### PILCHARDS

On the count of three.

#### UNAL

And then through that, a bond of brotherhood!

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Hot!

__[Tim laughs]__

#### BEN

*(groaning)* Awwwwwwwwww...

#### TIM

A band of brotherhood!

#### HELEN

*Brotherhood?*

__[Lydia cackling]__

#### TIM

The fact that you think that's hot says more about *you* than *us*!

__[pause]__

#### BEN

*(resigned)* It's been called, though.

__[Tim winces]__

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### BEN

It's been called. Next scene!

#### TIM

Next--

#### BEN

Lyd?

__[Lydia and Helen laughing]__

#### TIM

You monster.

#### HELEN

Lyd is gone. She's gone. __[laughs]__

#### LYDIA

Just having a dust bath.

#### TIM

Just havin' a--

#### BEN

What's your next scene though?

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Um...

#### TIM

Pervert.

__[Lydia laughs]__

__[Helen bursts out laughing]__

#### LYDIA

I--oh, should it be Alex watching again? __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Please, Alex, do the right thing.

__[Tim and Ben laugh]__

#### LYDIA

I'm gonna put this to Alex. He's going to be watching... something. Whether it is what was happening below, with __[laughs]__ us two and the unbelieving, or it's the bridge.

#### ALEX

Ah, you gotta make the call.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Yeah.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Oh, do I.

#### ALEX

This is your scene.

#### LYDIA

Okay.

#### HELEN

Which one do you prefer to see?

#### LYDIA

You have to see the one downstairs. The--

#### ALEX

So this is...

#### LYDIA

You're seeing the--

#### BEN

If you know what we mean.

__[Helen laugh]__

#### LYDIA

The du--the--yeah. We cut off on "UNBELIEVER!"

#### HELEN

__[laughs]__ Yes.

#### SHMERR

*(voice* *shaking* *with* *the* *ship's* *vibrations)* I find myself...

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

...enamoured with the idea of efficiency and how they've decided it'll run a little bit better with me outside.

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

I do notice... that in my initial assessment of the crew, there is slightly more tension...

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### SHMERR

...than I initially considered. Namely, the apparently killer robot.

__[loud laughter]__

#### SHMERR

Retrospectively, I should have addressed this in the initial crew assessments.

__[Lydia continues laughing throughout]__

#### SHMERR

So, with that in mind, I am keeping an assessment of the situation distantly. I cannot help but notice that at this stage, a significant portion of the budgie appears to be smeared on the walls of the--

__[everyone screaming]__

#### SHMERR

Thankfully, the main body of the budgie appears to have escaped.

#### LYDIA

Aaahh!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Just got one wing. __[chuckles]__

#### SHMERR

*(simult.)* But there is now some kind of killer robot, which I am choosing to consider a motivational...

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

...action for the team.

#### ALEX

Alex has to stop; he has cramping like *every* *muscle* *in* *his* *torso*.

#### BEN

Ah, that's--

#### LYDIA

Ohhh!

#### BEN

I thought that's why you weren't cutting.

#### LYDIA

That was--__[claps]__*--*incredible!

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### ALEX

Ughhh!

#### LYDIA

Way to get stage tortured, man. It's always about that.

#### TIM

Yeah. Live foley.

#### HELEN

Wonderful.

#### TIM

Wonderful.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

Wonderful.

#### LYDIA

Just, yeah, look at him.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* I mean, you made a--

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Look at the dedication there.

#### BEN

You made a choice, and you stuck with it.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

You did stick with it.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### ALEX

That's the one rule!

#### HELEN

It is!

#### TIM

Yeah, like a bad marriage, you just--

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

--stuck with it.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, go for it!

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

Go on.

#### HELEN

Yeah. That is a rule that I wrote down on my character sheet. Yeah. If you're interrupting, then... stick to it.

#### ALEX

Oh yeah.

#### HELEN

Yeah, that's what you said.

#### LYDIA

If you're in a bad marriage...

#### TIM

Stick with it.

#### LYDIA

I write that down often.

#### HELEN

Kill the man.

#### TIM

Yeah. You know.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### BEN

Ah.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

Make it look like an accident.

#### LYDIA

Yep.

#### HELEN

Yeah!

#### TIM

Right, the podcast has taken a turn. How do you--

#### BEN

Pour their blood--

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* All I was--

#### BEN

*(simult.)* --into your fuel pipe, and use it to power you--

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Lie around in your wedding dress.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* --for an hour of pressure.

#### ALEX

Somehow, we've gone from, like, marital murder, and we trace that back to I was just shaking a bit in a chair.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

#### ALEX

Wow.

#### HELEN

Yeah!

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### ALEX

Wow.

#### TIM

A lot on our minds today.

__[Alex laughs]__

#### HELEN

Yes. It's actually your turn to frame a scene.

#### ALEX

Right! In that case then, I would like... a scene... of... Mr. Squeakington joining the rest of the team on the bridge, in whatever state they're in.

#### TIM

Should we do that in media res? So, we'll be out--

#### ALEX

Very much so.

#### PILCHARDS

Now, on the count of three, drop the hat.

#### BEN

Uhhhh... well we did get called "hot."

#### ALEX

You did get called "hot."

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

*Ooh.*

__[Lydia chuckling]__

#### BEN

So, we have to be caught... *in* *flagrante*.

#### ALEX

I mean, in fairness...

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### ALEX

...you could do exactly the same line.

#### TIM

*Must* we?

#### ALEX

Just... *(close* *to* *mic)* really close.

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Right, now you're taking everything else off.

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### PILCHARDS

Drop the hat.

#### ALEX

*(muffled* *through* *hands)* Oh. Lydia made it a little weird!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

EEEP!

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* All right--all right--whoa--ah, there you--

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* Whoa! Whoa. Hello. Uh--uh--the--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Squeak! Squeak!

#### PILCHARDS

And that is obviously how you cool down.

#### UNAL

Yes. My uniform slipped!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, he's--yeah, it...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### PILCHARDS

...slipped off.

#### UNAL

Oh look--

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

--all these buttons have fallen off!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

And--my belt came undone.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

Right--quickly put--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

Rectify that!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep?

#### PILCHARDS

Oh.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeep.

#### UNAL

Um, yes, Mr. Squeakington, you appear to be... alive!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

Great. And maimed!

#### LYDIA

Uh--

#### PILCHARDS

Oh.

#### LYDIA

So, ironically, you guys might have had your clothes off. Mr. Squeakington is *plucked*.

__[laughter]__

#### BEN

Wait, did you run in?

__[continued laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, oh no!

#### LYDIA

He ran in. Or he hopped in!

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* It appears to be a nude bird.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* And he lost a lot of feathers in the dust-blood...

__[Helen laughing]__

#### LYDIA

...like--

#### ALEX

Extravaganza.

#### LYDIA

...extravaganza--

#### UNAL

Mr. S--!

#### LYDIA

--happening downstairs.

#### UNAL

Mr. Squeakington, have you no sense of PROPRIETY!

#### ALEX

__[laughs]__ *(laughing)* This is the bridge!

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* This is the *bridge!*

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult,* *muffled)* Nonbelievers.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### WORSHIPER

*(muffled)* Nonbelievers!

#### UNAL

Uh...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(simult.)* The--that robot is *really* problematic!

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult,* *muffled)* Nonbelievers! Nonbelievers!

#### PILCHARDS

Ah. All right.

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult.)* Nonbelievers! Nonbelievers!

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* Quick--quick action is needed. Let's lock down the bridge to keep the robot out!

#### UNAL

Okay, I'll--

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult,* *muffled)* NONBELIEVERS!

#### UNAL

--press this... button!

#### BEN

Boop!

#### PILCHARDS

Blast doors.

__[chuckling]__

#### SHIP

Bridge sealed.

#### UNAL

Right!

#### HELEN

*(simult,* *banging* *on* *door)* *Bmphh!*

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(simult,* *relieved)* Squeak!

#### HELEN

*(banging* *on* *door)* *Bmph-bmphh!*

#### UNAL

Um...

__[*Mr.* *Squeakington* does a relieved warble]__

#### PILCHARDS

Now. What--what--what happened?

#### ALEX

I will add those... in post!

#### HELEN

Okay, good.

__[Lydia chuckles]__

#### PILCHARDS

What happened, Mr. Squeakington?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Oh, well, I just suggested--see, I--because I was abandoned cruelly--

__[Helen and Tim laughing]__

#### UNAL

Ah. About that.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ummm...

#### PILCHARDS

*(laughing)* Oh, yeah. About that...

#### LYDIA

Like, so--the bird hops in between Many Legs and White Board and is facing--

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* 'Cause those are their names now!

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* --Many Legs--yeah!

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

My work is done.

#### LYDIA

He's facing Many Legs completely. I mean, like--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Well, since you're the only one *worth* *addressing*, since I was so *cruelly* abandoned...

#### UNAL

Ah, w--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

...uh, I was stuck in sap...

#### PILCHARDS

Uh-huh.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

...and then my feathers...

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

...uh, so urgently, dust bath. So, dust, then bath, then that worked so well, I suggested--EEP!--that, uh, instead of--eep!--the robot seeking--eep!--moisture, as they were saying they--eep!--urgently--eep!--needed to do, that they use some of the dust, in the dusty pit!

#### ALEX

Bear in mind, the entire time of this: *(banging* *on* *the* *door)* *boomphhh!*

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### ALEX

*Bmmmph!*

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### PILCHARDS

Hang on, hang on, hang on.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

So--

#### PILCHARDS

The dusty pit?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

And then--

#### PILCHARDS

You mea--you--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

--she got angry and then... *smeared* me on the walls.

#### PILCHARDS

In the dusty pit?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yeah!

#### PILCHARDS

You m--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

So now it's a--it's a dusty, bloody, sappy pit.

#### PILCHARDS

You mean you *mucked* *up* my dusty pit?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Well, I mean, there's not--

#### PILCHARDS

That's where I KEEP ALL MY STUFF!

#### LYDIA

Like... gestures sort of with her wings but there's... very little feather in the way, feathers attached to the wings right now.

#### UNAL

Deraldio! Deraldio--

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* Nah! No, this is--

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* Please! Please! Please. Darling.

__[laughter]__

#### UNAL

I mean, Deraldio!

__[laughter]__

#### UNAL

Uh--uh--Lieutenant Pilchards.

#### PILCHARDS

Look. I am just a little bit angry. That's where I kept all my plunder, my loot, my booty, my MINTS!

#### UNAL

No, you ate those.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh yeah. But anyway, you mussed it up with your blood, and your sap, and your feathers!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Trust me, I'd be much happier with my blood on the inside, too!

#### UNAL

Actually, thinking about it, as much as I enjoy this conversation...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

...we're all looking this way.

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* Yeah.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(simult.)* Eep.

#### UNAL

I turned the engines on.

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* Uh-huh.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(simult.)* Yep.

#### UNAL

Who's driving?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeeeahhh!

#### PILCHARDS

Uh...

#### BEN

Dangerous!

##### [klaxons sound and then fade out]

#### TIM

Danger.

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### HELEN

Ooh-ho-ho! *So* dangerous! Isn't it your go?

#### BEN

It is.

#### HELEN

Ben, what do you wanna see?

#### BEN

Uhhhhh...

#### ALEX

A massive explosion! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Wellllll...

__[Lydia chuckling]__

#### BEN

So, I would like one of Shmerr, watching the comet fast approaching.

#### ALEX

Yeah.

__[Lydia chuckles]__

#### ALEX

I'm on board with that.

#### BEN

From the outside of the ship.

#### SHMERR

*(voice* *shaking* *with* *the* *ship's* *vibrations)* Captain's log, supplemental--

#### BEN

Okay, just very quickly, remember, I didn't make him do this.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Oh no, it's just--it's--

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Yeah, no one made him.

#### ALEX

It's required. It's required.

#### SHMERR

*(voice* *shaking* *with* *ship's* *vibrations)* Captain's log supplemental: I have nothing but pride and respect for the navigator Many Legs in deciding to accelerate full force at the comet.

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### SHMERR

*(vibrating)* The increased speed has allowed us to arrive at our destination in what I estimate to be... at least three seconds spare. And in a lot of ways, if that isn't worth my death...

__[Tim chuckling]__

#### SHMERR

*(vibrating)* ...I don't know what is.

__[Tim and Lydia chuckling]__

#### SHMERR

*(vibrating)* And so this will probably be my last entry. I would just like to thank Many Legs, White Board, Baldy, and Killer Inceptive Robot...

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

*(vibrating)* ...while serving with me. Without their assistance I could never have guided this ship into a comet.

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

*(vibrating,* *starting* *to* *laugh)* For some reason.

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

*(vibrating)* I'm not sure why we're aiming at the comet, but we got there fast. And if that isn't a win, I don't know what is.

__[Lydia laughing]__

#### TIM

*(laughing)* So, is it the case that you don't even know about the moisture--

__[Helen laughs]__

#### ALEX

I have NO IDEA!

__[Helen bursts out laughing]__

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

I have *no* idea! I've just twigged that we're aiming for a comet and we got there quick!

__[laughter continues]__

#### HELEN

Oh, my--

#### LYDIA

Dangerous, I guess?

#### TIM

Yeah, dangerous.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Dangerous again. It's all dangerous.

#### BEN

Hey, Helen. __[chuckles]__

#### HELEN

You know what? I'd like to see a scene... with Squeakington, Unal, and Pilchards all panicking as they see a comet approaching.

__[klaxons sound; *Mr.* *Squeakington* squeaking in alarm]__

#### PILCHARDS

Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

#### UNAL

Oh, bloody hell!

#### PILCHARDS

Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

#### UNAL

Um, right--um--

#### PILCHARDS

Where are the brakes on this? Where are--

#### UNAL

Hang on, I'm pressing the go button!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeh, no! Not that--gah--not the--

#### SHIP

Accelerating.

#### UNAL

No! No no no no.

#### SHIP

Accelerating.

#### UNAL

I want to press it backwards!

#### SHIP

Accelerating.

#### PILCHARDS

Stop doing it, you moron!

#### SHIP

Accelerating.

__[Helen laughing quietly]__

#### TIM

I, uh--I--

#### LYDIA

Just starts attacking a speaker.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

RRREEEEEEEE!

#### TIM

I lunge for a brake lever.

#### ALEX

*(laughing)* 'Cause there's a *hand* *brake* in space!

__[laughter]__

#### BEN

Yeah, but it's a giant branch.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah.

__[laughter]__

#### PILCHARDS

Maybe if I pull this!

#### TIM

I pull the hand brake branch lever.

#### SHIP

Brakes engaged. Deceleration in T-minus... 13 minutes.

#### VARIOUS

Awwwwwwwwww!

#### BEN

Oh no!

#### PILCHARDS

We're in our last moments together. I think we can all agree that you, Ural, are, um--

#### UNAL

It's Unal.

#### PILCHARDS

That you, Unal--

#### BEN

Nope, out of time.

#### TIM

Aw.

__[Alex laughs]__

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeeeee!

#### ALEX

Cut. Danger! Boom.

##### [explosion]

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

Oh, it's not my turn.

#### BEN

Tim. It's your scene.

#### HELEN

Yeah. It's your scene, Tim.

#### TIM

Well, we--"out of time, boom."

#### BEN

No, out of time, *cut*.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### BEN

All I said was out of time. We could have concurrent scenes. It doesn't have to be chronological.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Yeah!

#### TIM

Okay, yeah, well let's have a concurrent scene. So, as that previous scene was taking--

#### ALEX

Also, you're assuming a lot of people breathe oxygen and, quite frankly...

__[Lydia chuckles]__

#### ALEX

...that's your problem, not ours.

#### TIM

Yeah, that's my--that's my privilege.

#### BEN

Well, we never really established the atmosphere in this ship, so.

#### TIM

Yeah. It's alllll just nitrogen.

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

Mm, tasty nitrogen. Try some today!

#### ALEX

Good for trees!

#### TIM

Good for treeeeees!

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

Um...

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

Right.

#### HELEN

So, what scene would you like?

#### TIM

So the scene will be the other side of the blast doors and Worshiper 2X7 trying to devise a way of entering the bridge, not knowing that the comet is soon to be a squashy hot friend.

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

Well, first cold, then very, *very* much hot.

#### TIM

Oh yeah!

#### HELEN

Hmm, let's think.

#### WORSHIPER

Engaging rams.

__[rams unfolding]__

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

Oh, no.

#### WORSHIPER

Engaging additional rams.

__[more rams unfolding]__

#### WORSHIPER

Engaging... corkscrew!

__[whirring]__

__[laughter]__

#### WORSHIPER

Attack. Attack. Attack.

#### SHIP

I would just like to wish you luck in converting all of the squishy inmates into fluid!

__[pause]__

#### WORSHIPER

Thank you, Ship.

#### SHIP

I'm just saying, if you want to share it out, I'm sure we could get along together.

#### WORSHIPER

Moisture?

#### SHIP

Moisture.

#### WORSHIPER

Moisture!

#### SHIP

Moisture.

#### WORSHIPER

Moisture.

#### SHIP

Moisture.

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

Cut.

#### BEN

Cut.

#### LYDIA

Cut!

#### TIM

Explosion!

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

I'm so proud of us that no one said hot.

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

It's only 'cause I was in the scene. If I was out of it, that'd been so hot, so fast.

#### HELEN

Okay. I--

#### TIM

"Moisture? *Moisture*."

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Hey, how 'bout--?

#### TIM

*(simult.)* "*Moisture?*"

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Moisture.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* "Oh, moistu--" __[laughs]__

#### ALEX

I just want it on the record, the second that Helen's running the show, this got *hot!* Got hot and steamy!

#### TIM

Hot in Cleveland!

#### HELEN

That's why I'm not allowed to run Monster Hearts.

__[laughter]__

#### HELEN

I think we have time for one more scene.

#### ALEX

Whose turn is it to call?

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Oh, it's me.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* It's Lydia's turn.

#### TIM

Lydia.

#### LYDIA

Cut to...

#### ALEX

Shmerr.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Shmerr.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Shmerr.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Yeah.

__[Helen chuckles]__

#### LYDIA

Shmerr. Standing on a scrap of ship hull... in a cloud of ice particles...

__[Helen laughing]__

#### LYDIA

...spinning around, with only a ship's log recorder in their hand.

#### ALEX

Thankfully I don't need to shake. The acceleration's done at least. I can--

#### LYDIA

Yeah yeah yeah, just floating.

#### BEN

But it's very cold so you're shivering.

__[laughter]__

#### ALEX

Don't you dare!

#### LYDIA

It is very cold, Alex.

#### ALEX

I'm in my suit. It's all good.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### ALEX

It's all good. It's all good.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* It's a cold suit.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Your suit has a leak.

__[Tim laughs]__

#### ALEX

Oh definitely.

__[chuckling]__

#### ALEX

Definitely.

#### SHMERR

Captain's log, supplemental. I, Shmerr, of the Dissolium Collective... do claim this comet--

__[Lydia and Ben laugh]__

#### SHMERR

--as a property of... me.

__[Helen laughs]__

#### SHMERR

And would like to pay my respects to the dedicated crew that sacrificed their lives so nobly that I might obtain my personal mission. To Many Legs: he had... many legs.

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

I never heard his voice, but I liked to think it was bassy, in a comforting manner. Certainly, White Board seemed to think so.

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

White Board: you were always so efficient apparently, at everything apart from people management.

__[chuckling]__

#### SHMERR

But that's okay. Not everyone's as charismatic as Shmerr.

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

And then Baldy.

__[Tim laughs]__

#### LYDIA

*(disgruntled)* Squeak.

#### SHMERR

I'm so sorry, Baldy, that you had to lose your feathers in the pursuit of our--our shared dream that I presume you share.

__[chuckling]__

#### SHMERR

But take heart from knowing that, as you bounced around the bridge like a ping-pong ball in a washing machine...

__[Helen laughing]__

#### SHMERR

...you managed to hit the escape pod button, and at least sent some message of our success out into the void. And so, I bring myself full circle to Incenti-bot.

__[Lydia chuckles]__

#### SHMERR

I've--I've--I've called you Incenti-bot because that, Incenti-bot, is what you are. In a lot of ways, you were the most valuable member of my crew. Whenever I was thinking, "How? How will I get them to the bridge to get me to a comet apparently?"

__[loud laughter]__

#### SHMERR

Incenti-bot was there.

__[Helen chuckles]__

#### SHMERR

Seducing.

__[Tim chuckles]__

#### SHMERR

Killing.

__[Tim and Lydia chuckle]__

#### SHMERR

Harvesting for moisture, *even* as the impact was happening.

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

And so, I would like to close this log. Comfortable in the knowledge that this comet has been claimed. __[pause]__ And as I see that bloody awful tree *buggering* off, finally...

__[laughter]__

#### SHMERR

...I can rest calm and happy knowing that, in some small way, we all made a difference. But mostly, mostly it was me, Shmerr.

__[Ben laughing]__

#### HELEN

Awww.

#### LYDIA

Cut!

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Wonderful.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Beautiful.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* I think that is a lovely--

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Hot! Hot!

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Hot!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* --note to end on.

#### BEN

Hot! Hot.

#### TIM

Ooh.

__[Lydia laughs]__

#### TIM

Sexy isolation!

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

*Ooh*, leave me on my own! Arrrgh!

#### ALEX

*(laughing,* *as* *Shmerr)* What a curvy chunk of ice.

#### HELEN

Ah, don't!

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Now we--yeah, now we're getting a crossover.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* The Magnus fandom will get a hold of that.

__[laughter]__

#### TIM

Ohh, I'm just on my own with a tape recorder. *Ooooh!*

#### BEN

Oh, no.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Oh no, it is...

#### BEN

*(simult.)* On your own, just--with his own beard.

__[Helen laughs]__

#### LYDIA

...genuinely a bad thing.

#### HELEN

Right. Did we all have fun?

#### LYDIA

Yes.

#### TIM

Yeah!

#### ALEX

*(simult,* *proudly)* I did not interact...

#### BEN

*(simult.)* No. No, it was terrible. It was awful.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* N-no. I hated it. __[laughs]__

#### ALEX

...with a single character, and that is--if that isn't an RPG win, I don't know what is!

__[chuckling]__

#### HELEN

Very good. We're very proud of you, Alex.

__[Alex laughs]__

#### LYDIA

Yes.

__[Ben chuckling]__

#### HELEN

Ah! Well. I hope you had fun as well.

__[laughter]__

#### HELEN

Listeners.

__[Alex giggling quietly]__

#### HELEN

Dearest listeners.

#### TIM

Dearest listeners.

#### BEN

Yeah, I guess, uh... one thing is you can... get Vast & Starlit, if you google it.

#### HELEN

Oh!

#### ALEX

Yes.

#### BEN

And--

#### HELEN

Yeah, genuinely. But you should also pay for it 'cause you should always pay for your games.

#### BEN

Yes. It is a pay-what-you-want, and it does say on the website that you can preview it for free.

#### HELEN

Mm-hmm.

#### BEN

But, yeah, it is pay-what-you-want, so. If you like it, pay for it.

#### LYDIA

Yaay!

#### BEN

Even if it's, like, fifty cents, or a dollar, or a pound. If you're--

#### LYDIA

Or a euro.

#### ALEX

One *hundred* pounds!

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Yeah, 'cause let's be honest--

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Or one hundred pounds.

#### LYDIA

--what will a pound be worth by the time--

#### BEN

*(simult.)* That's true.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* --this is broadcast?

__[Alex laughs]__

#### BEN

One million pounds!

#### HELEN

Oh my gosh. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Right. One discarded car part that you can trade for some mystery meat.

__[chuckles]__

#### HELEN

Several plastic bags which have shot up in value.

#### LYDIA

*(laughs)* Yeah.

#### ALEX

This has all gone to such a...

#### LYDIA

Just filled with tap water.

#### ALEX

*(laughing)* ...strange, strange place.

__[Helen laughs]__

#### TIM

*(laughing)* Plastic Sainsbury's bags filled with tap water!

#### BEN

Fifteen of Theresa May's career.

__[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Ooooohhhhhh!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Worthless, Ben! They're all worthless!

__[Ben laughing]__

#### ALEX

*(laughing)* Bye guys.

#### ALL

Bye!

#### ALEX

Hot!
