##### [Rusty Quill Gaming podcast theme]

#### HELEN

Hello and welcome to the Rusty Quill Gaming Podcast. It is I, Helen Gould, being poured into your ear holes right now. You are--

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### TIM

Into your ear cups!

#### HELEN

Oh, yes!

#### LYDIA

Cup your ears!

##### [Helen laughs]

#### BEN

Well, I'm Ben Meredith.

#### ALEX

I'm Alex Newall.

#### LYDIA

I'm Lydia Nicholas.

#### TIM

And I'm Tim Callum Tyler Meredith.

#### ALEX

And I'm noticing we're all close to the mic now.

#### TIM

Mm.

__Helen: (simult.)__ Oh, we're so close... Yes.

__Lydia: (simult.)__ Oh, in your ear holes.

__Tim: (simult.)__ It's radio silk.

__Alex: (simult.)__ This is going to be so unpleasant.

__Ben: (simult.)__ I am so fluid.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

Oh, no!

#### HELEN

Speaking of fluid, that is the main goal of what we're trying to do.

#### TIM

Oh yeah!

#### LYDIA

Yay!

#### BEN

But not blood!

#### TIM

Not blood! __[laughs]__

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Hopefully not blood. We are playing Vast & Starlit by Epidiah Ravachol. We are about to have a team meeting possibly? We do not know.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### BEN

Well, Alex gets to define a scene.

#### LYDIA

The stakes are admin.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### ALEX

No, no, I haven't been in a scene. It's passed from whoever's in a scene I thought.

#### BEN

Ah, no, It's-- you go around in a circle.

#### ALEX

Oh, do I get to define a scene?

#### TIM

You're round the horn.

#### HELEN

Yeah!

#### LYDIA

Yeah, you're in charge.

#### TIM

You don't have to define yourself in it but--

#### ALEX

OH! Oh, the magboot's on the other foot now!

__Helen: [laughs]__ Yes. This is turn based. The last person to have a turn was Lydia and--

#### BEN

Unfortunately--

#### HELEN

--you can't see the table so, you know, anyone could be next but it's actually Alex next.

#### ALEX

Is it always two people or can it be more?

#### HELEN

It can be however many you want.

#### ALEX

Okay, in which case I would suggest a team meeting involving... everyone except Shmerr __[laughter]__ and I would suggest that is at *the base* of the tree. So not deep down where the, the pit is necessarily, but where the real guts of the 'engine' in inverted commas are. For everyone to discuss the current water crisis and, and how to, how to deal with it.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### ALEX

I'll-- I'm not there.

##### [snorts]

#### BEN

So, I've set up a whiteboard. __[laughter]__ Yes, and I am striding side to side in front of it, trying to poke at things with a stick. I don't know how people are listening but...

#### LYDIA

I'm perched on the white board and the white board is slightly reflective so I'm leaning down into it and I can see myself and I'm pecking furiously at my reflected image in the white board.

#### TIM

I'm hunkered in a corner, pointedly putting mints into my mouth one after the other.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Nom, nom, nom.

#### TIM

Nom, nom.

#### HELEN

I have retracted my limbs and I look just like a metal box. __[Lydia laughs]__ But I am paying attention. This is my listening state.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

Peck! Peck peck peck. Peck peck!

#### BEN

And you just see Schmee sort of floating outside the-- looking through the porthole.

#### HELEN

Shmerr.

#### TIM

Shmerr. Shmerr.

#### BEN

Shmerr.

#### LYDIA

Shmerr.

#### HELEN

Shmerr, Schmee, who cares?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Peck.

#### SHMERR

I agree. If it could just be Sh, it'd be quicker. More efficient.

##### [laughter]

##### [Lydia starts pecking intermittently]

#### UNAL

So, the way that we're going to find this scanner is we are going to, uh, divide the ship into four quadrants and we're each going to sweep a quadrant. And that way we can cover four times the ground as fast as that happens. So, moving on, once we make contact with the scanner, we need to develop some sort of way to communicate with it.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

I will communicate with the scanner.

#### UNAL

Yes, potentially if it is mechanical. But it might be bioorganic.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

I must-- this, this invader-- peck peck peck-- this invader-- peck-- this, this-- I need to deal with him first.

#### LYDIA

Starts violently attacking--

#### UNAL

This is your reflection.

##### [chuckles]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Oh. That's a matter of opinion.

#### UNAL

Allow me to illustrate.

#### BEN

The section that you're pecking I get my white board marker out and just color it in so that it becomes not reflective anymore.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep. Well done.

##### [laughter]

#### UNAL

The invader is defeated... and this is why I should be in command of the army!

#### PILCHARDS

Now, I don't wanna burst anybody's bubble but I've been hav'in' an lil' think in the corner. Yum yum yum.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Please contribute.

#### PILCHARDS

Now, this sweeping system, lovely as it is and well done Cakey, I think perhaps there is a quicker way.

#### UNAL

And what would you think that would be? Also, can I have a mint?

#### PILCHARDS

Well-- Ah, I've eaten them all, I'm sorry. Nom nom nom.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Pops the last one in afterwards!

#### TIM

No, really slowly just brings up to his mouth, places it on his tongue, and just draws his tongue back into his mouth.

#### BEN

How long is your tongue?

#### TIM

Two feet.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

And this just takes a while.

#### TIM

And there's a little tapping noise that goes __[tapping noise]__. __[laughter]__ Nom nom nom.

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

Why must we go scantering and scampering about this ship like rocks dropped down a flight of stairs when we could just ask the ship itself, y'know?

#### UNAL

Right, very good. Ship, where is your scanner?

#### PILCHARDS

You can't, you can't just yell at the ship.

#### UNAL

I can and I am.

#### PILCHARDS

Well, 'ave a go, we'll see what 'appens.

#### UNAL

Ship! Reveal your secrets. Where is your scanner?

__Ship (Alex):__ Hello.

#### PILCHARDS

Aww, damn.

#### SHIP

How can I... be of assistance?

#### UNAL

Where's your scanner? We need to find a comet. To feed you. Water?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Not, not a comet that's a, for a small computer parts. A water one.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

You require refueling. Where is moisture?

#### PILCHARDS

Go on. Give us a clue boy-o.

#### SHIP

I will... when I can get a word in... edgeways.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

I don't like it. Squeak!

#### SHIP

The scanner...

#### PILCHARDS

[incomprehensible??] though don't trust him.

##### [Mr Squeakington squeaks]

#### SHIP

The scanner... can be located... in the aft... manual compartment.

#### PILCHARDS

Now, is aft the one that's the backwards at the pointy bit or the front?

#### LYDIA

Just starts furiously attacking whatever speaker.

#### UNAL

Well, given that the other one is the fore, and the word forward exists, I'm going to guess... the back.

#### PILCHARDS

You don't have to be a ding-dong about it, Urinal Cakes.

#### LYDIA

Attacking.

#### UNAL

Well, my name is Unal and you've refused to call me that so, touché.

#### LYDIA

Just furiously attacking the speaker that the sound came out of. Eep!

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

Alright then. Perhaps I will, uh, pop down the aft then and find this scanner and, uh, and pop a lil' comety request into it. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? We like that? Yeah, we like it.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

I will accompany you.

#### UNAL

As will I.

#### PILCHARDS

Aww, it doesn't have to be like a party. We can just like, two is enough. You know, you're needed up here in the, in-in the command room, you know, like a center of a brain.

#### UNAL

Oh, yes, very good. Actually, yes, that is a good place for the commander to be. I will think about our next moves and put them down on this white board.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, please.

#### UNAL

I'm gonna draw some arrows and some grids. It's going to be wonderful.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, I look forward to it.

#### UNAL

Good. I'm glad. [__Pilchards:__ Yeah.] I'm glad you're getting in the spirit of things, Pilchards.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah yeah, no, you're a, you're a born leader and I follow you to the ends of my feet. Now, why don't we pop down the aft of the ship *and see if we can find* a lovely lil' box or some'ing.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

I would like to find a box.

#### PILCHARDS

Or some'ing.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Or something.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay.

__Alex: [unsure]__ Hot?

__Tim: [laughing]__ Not for that.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

Hot. Hot.

#### TIM

That's not how it goes.

#### BEN

Hot.

#### LYDIA

Hot.

#### BEN

It's hot.

#### LYDIA

It's hot.

#### ALEX

Hot.

#### BEN

Hot.

#### LYDIA

Hot.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### PILCHARDS

Look, we've all got urges.

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

It's hot.

#### LYDIA

Oh, it's hot.

#### HELEN

Okay. We'll resolve that the next time me or Tim are in--

#### BEN

A scene.

#### HELEN

A scene.

#### BEN

Cool.

#### TIM

So what happens? I'm not going for this.

#### BEN

I want to see a scene of Shmerr, on their own, __[laughter]__ looking through the porthole at the progress that the Worshiper and Pilchards are making. [__Tim:__ Um, can I--] As he crawls from porthole to porthole tracking them.

#### HELEN

Can Gaia communicate outside of the ship?

#### ALEX

I'm gonna say no?

#### LYDIA

No.

__Alex: (simult.)__ Otherwise I'll break.

__Helen: (simult.)__ Okay, so you're going to be talking to yourself on the--

#### ALEX

Yeah, I'm fine talking to myself for a while.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

##### [Lydia laughs]

##### [SFX: breathing in a space suit]

#### SHMERR

Uh, personal diary of Shmerr day... I'm not sure: __[laughter]__ I have found myself at the bottom--I think it's called the bottom--of the ship. Unfortunately, my papers remain inside so I am attempting to communicate with the crew through the portholes. They are very much not listening, that's fine. So, as the commander of this vessel, __[laughter]__ it is, it is my duty to ensure that things happen efficiently and sometimes that involves a hands-off method, so I'm told. __[laughter]__ I noticed that two of them--I never caught their names--are heading somewhere else so I am going to attempt to follow them. Diary entry of Shmerr number two: they have made it into a room which has items within it. That's good. They are stood very close to one another and they are attempting to find a thing. As commander of this vessel, I approve of this action. I'm glad they are anticipating my orders and I am sure this will be fine. Oh! Oh, I think one of them might have tripped over... into the other one's arms. Good that they caught them. I'm glad that my crew care for one another. __[laughter]__ That's a lot of arms. Oh, they-- oh, this is, uh-- I may have to file an incident report. It appears they may be choking. __[laughter]__ Uh, it's-it's okay though. One of them is apparently helping them out in some way-- Goodness me! That is a very long tongue. __[laughter]__ I believe they may have been trying to look for the scanner and it-it's on the floor. It's between their feet. If they just look down-- Oh, no! That's not looking down! Goodness me. Thank goodness it's zero G or someone would be getting hurt. __[laughter]__ And that's, that's fine. And I guess I'll just __[tapping]__ tap on the window-- No, they're-- They can't hear. That's fine. Oh, no! One of them's, one of them's picked up the sca-- That's not what the scanner is used for. __[SFX ends]__

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

Cut!

#### HELEN

Oh!

#### TIM

Well.

#### HELEN

Good grief. Oh, it's my turn to think of a scene. I'm gonna leave that there.

#### ALEX

I think that's really wise. __[Helen laughs]__ I'm not sure how I became a peeping Tom but here I am!

__Ben: (simult.)__ I mean, with that voice--

__Tim: (simult.)__ Hot! Some people like to watch.

#### BEN

With that voice.

__Tim: [imitating Shmerr]__ Oh, no!

#### BEN

That voice is wearing a dirty anorak.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

Even without your glands you still exuded some fluid.

#### HELEN

Okay. I would like to see Unal and Mr. Squeakington attempting to figure out what the next steps are if the scanner is found.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Well they're taking a while. Eep!

#### UNAL

Yes, well, maybe the scanner's well hidden.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Mm, yeah.

#### UNAL

So, Corporal Squeakington--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

How would you find a scanner? Would there need to be another scanner? __[gasps]__ We should find the scanner for the scanner! The scanner scanner! Eep!

#### UNAL

Ship?!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ship.

#### SHIP

Yes?

#### UNAL

Is there a scanner for the scanner?

#### SHIP

Of course.

#### UNAL

Oh good. Where's that?

#### SHIP

In the fore storage compartment.

#### UNAL

Right. Well let's go there then.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yep, makes sense.

#### UNAL

We'll find that-- we'll find that scanner scanner in a jiffy!

__Mr Squeakington: [laughing]__ Yes.

#### UNAL

So, Corporal Squeakington, how are you finding, uh, your enscripted life so far?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Wait, what? I didn't change my name.

#### UNAL

Lieutenant?

__Mr Squeakington: [stutters]__

#### UNAL

Well, Mr. isn't a military rank so...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

It's my name!

#### UNAL

Okay, Lieutenant Mr. Squeakington.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Is that a promotion?

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Okay!

##### [SFX: background bugs in a forest noise]

#### UNAL

Brilliant. Right. Very good lieutenant. So, how are you--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

What does that make you?

#### UNAL

Me? Uh, well, obviously it's in my name, [__Mr Squeakington:__ You're a lieutenant?] *Commander* Unal Manspray.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ah! Is a lieutenant better than a communal?

#### UNAL

No, commander.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

No, but it's different. A lieutenant has, uh, different responsibilities. They command a unit.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ah.

#### UNAL

So, how are you finding the command of your unit?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Well, I told you what to do and you did it, so that's great.

#### UNAL

Good managing upwards then.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Squeak! Squeak.

#### LYDIA

As we go past a porthole, I spot an enemy!

##### [Tim laughs]

#### UNAL

Ah, wait.

#### BEN

I color in the porthole. __[marker coloring noises]__

##### [laughter]

__Shmerr: [disappointed]__ Aww.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

The way the light reflected I was attacking myself.

#### TIM

And as you, as you're coloring it in, you, you-- I saw a flagging, "ooh, ooh, ooh" and just sort of, like, try to peek over the color and it just, it just absolutely blocks you out.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Surrounded by enemies. Eep!

#### UNAL

Yes, well, a good commander knows how to help their lieutenants. [__Mr Squeakington:__ Eep!] So, I'm defeating these enemies for you, see. __[more squeaks]__ Right, so...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Scanner?

#### UNAL

Yes, well, I think this might be the, the fore storage cupboard so let's just open this up here and...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

That's a tiny bird--

#### UNAL

That is a lot of sap.

#### LYDIA

--is grabbing onto the handle and trying to-- __[loud clank as the door opens]__ Tiny bird.

#### UNAL

Gosh, you're strong!

##### [laughter]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

It's the low gravity.

#### UNAL

Right.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### UNAL

Okay, well that's just--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Also, I, I have a much bigger and more impressive form in a different dimension.

#### UNAL

Ah. __[stutters]__ Very interesting. Well, you look like a very tiny budgie now so quite shocking seeing you just heft that door completely off of its hinges.

__Mr Squeakington: [laughs]__ I am a tiny, tiny budgie. Don't know my own strength. Squeak.

##### [SFX: mechanical whirring noise added]

#### UNAL

Well-- Well, there's quite a lot of sap in there so I-I don't know if wouldn't mind but __[stutters]__ this is the only uniform I've got and I'd rather keep it-- It's not very good for the commander to look dirty, so if you wouldn't mind going inside and getting the scanner scanner, that'd be greatly appreciated. I might even give you a commendation.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Oh, is-- can I eat it?

#### UNAL

The sap or the scanner scanner?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Or the commendation.

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Okay. Into the sap. __[squelch]__

#### ALEX

I'd say difficult.

##### [SFX end]

#### TIM

Yeah, getting a scanner out of the sap. Sap locker.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### ALEX

Sappy, sappy scanner.

#### LYDIA

Especially when you're made of feathers.

#### HELEN

Yeah, you've got feathers.

#### LYDIA

Yep.

#### HELEN

Yeah, that's gonna-- you're gonna get *clogged*.

#### LYDIA

Just "oh no!"

#### TIM

Like that film *The Sap Locker*. You know.

##### [laugher]

#### ALEX

I want you to know how on board I am with Helen being in charge. I didn't call that "hot". Could've done.

#### TIM

Could've done.

#### ALEX

Tryin' a help.

#### TIM

Trying to help.

#### ALEX

Team player Alex.

#### LYDIA

Just "difficult".

#### HELEN

Thank you very much.

#### TIM

You did call the last thing "hot" though.

#### ALEX

It was.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### HELEN

Apparently, apparently it was. __[Alex laughs]__ Timothy, it's your turn.

#### TIM

Oh--

#### ALEX

Oh you've been graduated to a Timo-- __[breaks off laughing]__

##### [Helen laughs]

#### TIM

[??] I just. __[sighs]__ We find ourselves back in the original meeting room and Deraldio and, uh, Worshiper 2X7 have returned... holding the scanner proudly and, and expecting praise, only to find that everyone has gone.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, this is quite a to-do. This is quite a to-do. We've found it now. We've found it and we're ready to find some, some watery, watery comets and they've all gone. They've all [nosed?] off, innit?

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Well it is time to operate it.

#### PILCHARDS

Alright. Alright, I'll pass this over to you. It's mechanical like you. It's your kin.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

It is. We are along the same... design lines.

#### PILCHARDS

We'll ha-- We'll have a bang on this then.

#### TIM

I hand over the, uh, scanner to her.

#### BEN

It sounds like you already have.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

Eyy!

#### ALEX

Whomp whomp.

#### PILCHARDS

Brush it down with this chamois leather. It'll be fine.

##### [laugher]

#### HELEN

Worshiper 2X7 inserts the scanner into a slot like a USB.

#### LYDIA

Oh.

#### TIM

It's what, it's what I was trying to do earlier. I was just furiously trying to-- __[laughs]__

#### ALEX

So you mean you try it once and then-- __[SFX: computer beeping noises]__

#### HELEN

And then turn it around.

#### ALEX

Oh no, you were right the first time! Flip it back around.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Moisture detected.

#### PILCHARDS

Ah, wonderful. Where's-- __[stutters]__ where is that precious?

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Moisture detected: one foot away.

#### PILCHARDS

Ah, okay, we might need to re-calibrate this. __[laughter]__ Please, you know, I do, I do know I contain moisture but it's not for that. And you know what, I'll just--

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Are you sure?

#### PILCHARDS

I'm pretty sure it stays inside.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Moisture is multipurpose.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay, you know, but--

#### BEN

Dangerous.

#### ALEX

Yeah!

#### LYDIA

Dangerous.

#### HELEN

Gettin' dangerous. __[laughs]__

#### ALEX

The android's discovered that they're *all water bags!*

##### [Helen laughs]

#### BEN

I've cut it.

#### TIM

You cut it. Oh, you just cut it.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, cut it.

#### HELEN

Yep.

#### BEN

Dangerous. Yeah.

#### TIM

Oh yeah.

#### LYDIA

Cut it there.

#### ALEX

I agree.

#### BEN

We'll see how that one ends.

#### TIM

Gah, our relationship has taken some roller coaster turn. You know.

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

Those well-known whirlwind romance murders.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah yeah. __[Helen laughs]__ I was in the forest for a long time on my own so... __[Tim and Ben chuckle]__

#### HELEN

Um, you--

#### ALEX

It's more like a femme fatal error.

##### [Ohh's]

#### ALEX

Femme fatal error. I can't make it parse, but you know what? It works on the page.

__Ben: (simult.)__ No, the idea's solid. Workshop it.

#### TIM

Could I perhaps, um--

#### BEN

Come back to us next week.

#### ALEX

I will. I will.

#### TIM

--resubmit *The Sap Locker* in that case?__ [laughter]__ Consideration further on *The Sap Locker*.

#### BEN

You think you deserve more for the one?

__Tim: [laughs]__ No. No, but I'd like more for it.

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Lydia.

#### LYDIA

I think that Ben's character will turn up and see the tail end of whatever was happening there.

#### HELEN

Ooh.

#### TIM

Oh, between... between, uh, Deraldio and--

#### HELEN

Between Pilchards and Worshiper 2X7.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

Delradio Pilchards.

#### HELEN

2X7 is beginning to advance.

##### [SFX: electric saw noise]

#### PILCHARDS

Now, let's all calm down. Let's all calm down. I have--

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Must acquire moisture.

#### UNAL

Well, yes, that's the mission, isn't it?

#### PILCHARDS

Nah, nah, you don't understand, Ural. You don't understand.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Additional moisture discovered.

#### PILCHARDS

Now, it's, it's all got--

#### UNAL

Okay, the problem has become very rapidly obvious.

##### [Alex and Lydia laugh]

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah. Yeah. Now, I know you and I don't get on but I don't want either of us--

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Must acquire moisture.

__Pilchards: (simult.)__ Can we count moisture source--

__Unal: (simult.)__ Yeah, well, we should do so from a comet. From a comet.

##### [electric saw stops]

#### PILCHARDS

We need to use cold, hard logic on this. This is a very logical being.

#### UNAL

But the plan. Look at the white board.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, look at the white board.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

White board does not contain moisture.

#### UNAL

No, but--

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Biological beings.

#### PILCHARDS

Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Worshiper, now sure, do we contain moisture? Yeah, we all know that. That's something we've all come to accept. I'm full of moisture. He's full of moisture. You? Not so much. It would ruin your chips. But we've only got a lil' bit of moisture in each of us. Barely get you a parsec. Barely get you that far. So how 'bout, how 'bout you helping us helping you get to a much, a much larger source of water. Oh, I don't know, just casting about for ideas, perhaps a comet.

##### [Lydia chuckles]

#### UNAL

Also, I have my old service ray gun.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay, now you-- __[laughter]__ Could we not have seen if my thing had worked first? __[laughter continues]__ Before we go straight to the-- You did this on my home world. You did-- We tried to talk to you and you were like, "also, ray gun" and it was *very* unhelpful.

#### UNAL

A: Good impression. B: Well, you were all living in dirty holes so...

##### [Ooh's]

#### PILCHARDS

A dirty hole. I'll have you know that dusty is not the same thing as dirty. If it's a dry piece of earth, that's not the same thing as dirty. I felt that I-- Please Worshiper, I'm-- __[stutters]__ Give me a second. __[laughter]__

#### LYDIA

A lil' tension.

#### TIM

A lil'-- Look.

#### ALEX

I feel like Worshiper's stood there by the way with at least two circular saws out spinning, good to go. And it's like, "oh yeah, fair enough. That was completely uncalled for. Yeah."

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

If we are gonna work together effectively as a team, as much as it hurts me to say that we might have to, you're gonna have to stop talking that way about *me* and my people.

#### UNAL

Then you're going to have to call me Unal. Commander Unal Manspray.

#### PILCHARDS

Alright, I think a détente can be reached. Ural-- I've forgotten.

##### [laughter]

#### UNAL

Commander! Unal! Manspray!

#### PILCHARDS

You are Commander Ural Manspray.

#### UNAL

And your holes were positively lovely.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### PILCHARDS

Thank you. That's all I've ever wanted a military commander to say to me whilst holding a ray gun in the presence of a killer robot.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Adjusting scanner functions.

#### UNAL

Oh, what, was it that easy?

#### PILCHARDS

The parameters-- is it shifting? Now, I-I know it-- maybe it's a bit of, a bit--

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Scanning outside of vessel.

#### UNAL

Oh, very good.

#### PILCHARDS

Could I just ask a quick question. Was it my logical work or his gun that made the real difference for you?

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

It was boredom.

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

Ahh.

#### UNAL

So both.

##### [SFX: scanner beeps]

#### PILCHARDS

Both. __[Lydia laughs]__ High five. Woah. Put down the gun. __[laughter]__ Holster.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Comet located. Two point five parsecs away.

#### PILCHARDS

Excellent.

#### UNAL

Right. Well, now we need to find the, um, __[snaps fingers]__ cabin.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh yeah.

#### UNAL

Cockpit. Flying place.

#### PILCHARDS

Uh, computer.

#### SHIP

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

Ah, 'ow you doin'?

#### SHIP

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay. We need to find the, uh, what would you call it? Bridge. Steering place. Wheelhouse.

#### SHIP

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, could you tell me where it is?

#### SHIP

The bridge is located... on the bridge.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay. Now, as true as that is, could you perhaps tell me where from here the bridge might be?

#### SHIP

Up.

#### PILCHARDS

Well, you know what? We've got an instruction. __[laughter]__ Just head up to the bridge.

#### UNAL

Yes. We have a heading.

#### HELEN

Right. Cut

#### BEN

Cut.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

Thank.

#### LYDIA

Cut.

#### BEN

Ah.

#### ALEX

I want you to know, I really wanted to-- if I was going to do a computer, not be a generic Newall, completely unhelpful, really annoying NPC.

#### BEN

And yet you do remain Alex.

#### LYDIA

And yet...

#### ALEX

And I, I can't help it. It's a real compulsion.

#### TIM

It's almost as if you interact with computers on a daily basis that are kind of like that.

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

It is now Alex's turn to frame a scene.

##### [all take turns going 'mm' and humming, increasingly dramatically for a full 10 seconds]

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

I am going to frame a scene. [__Helen:__ Mm-hmm.] Worshiper 2X7 has gone off on a hunt to find Mr. Squeakington who has now been missing for hours and hours.

__Tim: [laughing]__ I just remembered that means that you've just-- Ural just abandoned Mr. Squeak--

#### BEN

Oh, I was going to do a bit about how I was really sad about having lost my first soldier in action, but we got straight into--

#### ALEX

This is, this was my implication. Yeah, so, Worshiper 2X7 has, has managed to find Mr. Squeakington exactly where Mr. Squeakington was left.

#### LYDIA

Just stuck.

#### ALEX

Just, just so stuck!

#### HELEN

Like 30 centimeters inside. __[laughs]__

__Mr Squeakington: [squeaks angrily]__

#### LYDIA

So furious. Such a furious little bird.

__Mr Squeakington: [squeaks some more]__

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Hello biological organism. __[squelching noises]__ Do you require assistance.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeh.

#### LYDIA

That's a swear word in her language.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

I do not understand your language.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yes.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Very well. Extending arms.

##### [Mr. Squeakington yells, power tool sounds, squelching]

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Budgie retrieved.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Squeak. So sticky.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Do you require assistance with your... covering material?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Flap. I need a dust bath.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Hmmmm...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Not a moisture bath.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Dust bath.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Dust bath.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Explain.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

It's a bath. It's made of dust.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Where is dust?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Umm... in the hole.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

To the hole!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

The hole is dusty.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

I shall assist.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yay!

#### BEN

Cut.

#### LYDIA

Tries to fly but stuck.

#### ALEX

You're taking a sap covered bird into his lovely hole?

#### TIM

Yeah. __[stammers]__ And mussing up all my lovely dust.

#### ALEX

Mussing up his dust.

#### TIM

You wait 'til I get home buster.

#### LYDIA

I need, need the dust to live!

#### HELEN

Aww. Cool. Right.

#### LYDIA

Fortunately, don't have much moisture.

__Helen: [laughs]__ Yeah, it should be a very easy thing to do.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Right. So, we are trying to find the bridge and also bathe a bird in dust.

#### BEN

Mm-hmm.

#### HELEN

Let's see if we--

#### TIM

Two equally important tasks. __[laughter]__ The survival of us all and the dusting of a bird.

__Helen: (simult.)__ Oh yeah, and Alex's character is somewhere.

__Shmerr: (simult.)__ Also, I'm here.

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Right. We'll see you after the break and see what happens.

##### [pause for break]

#### HELEN

And welcome back to the Rusty Quill Gaming podcast with an anarchic model of gaming. So, we are now at... yes, it's Ben's turn to frame a scene.

#### BEN

Hullo!

#### HELEN

Hello! What do you want to see?

#### BEN

I want to-- I actually, I want to follow this dust bath.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Follow the action!

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Oh, yes! That's what the listeners all like.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

What's going on with this bath? Come on.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

My feathers, they're so sticky and--

#### ALEX

Hot!

#### LYDIA

--it's so urgent. __[laughter]__ Yeah, well, if you want to cut because it got too hot...

#### ALEX

No no, I cut-- No no no, let's let this, let this play.

#### LYDIA

That android is gettin' a lot of action!

#### ALEX

Let this play.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Please take me to the dust. I'm so... I'm so sticky.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Pit is reached.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Oh, okay.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Shall I drop?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Urgency-- Yes.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Dropping.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Please, sa-- Ahhh! __[thump]__

#### LYDIA

Your thump was better. Thump.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Is that agreeable?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Just flutters around in the dust.

#### ALEX

The gentle splat of sap spraying out across--

#### LYDIA

Spray--

#### TIM

All over my lovely things!

#### LYDIA

Sap is getting everywhere.

#### TIM

And I would say--

#### LYDIA

Shuffling around.

#### TIM

From, from Worshiper's point of view just a cloud of dust rising out of the pit hole.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

No, you know, you know __[laughs]__ that thing when swans get in the water and they wiggle their tail.

#### HELEN

Mm.

#### ALEX

Yes!

#### LYDIA

Yeah, how they always wiggle their tail.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

But that's, that's just the budgie just all over like __[Ben chuckles]__ all the wiggle of satisfaction.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

One hour remaining of moisture reserves.

__Mr Squeakington: [echoing]__ Ah, but this is very important, and the stakes were really so high.

##### [laughter]

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Worshiper 2X7 moisture reserves.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ah! Well--

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Will power down in T-minus sixty minutes.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Could, could you try dust instead of moisture? Squeak!

__Worshiper 2X7: [threateningly]__ That is heresy.

##### [laughter]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Uh, it's just that--

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Nonbeliever!

#### TIM

Danger.

#### ALEX

Danger! __[laughter]__ Dangerous!

#### TIM

Danger Will Robinson.

#### HELEN

Dangerous! Okay.

__Tim: [laughing]__ Oh, so far all of the danger involves you becoming rogue. __[Helen laughs]__ I'm sensing a theme. In many ways, isn't the solution to this to chuck you out of the damn airlock. __[laughter]__ And then we just have a lovely space boat sojourn. __[laughter continues]__ Oh, we must save this thing that consistently tries to kill us otherwise it might kill us. Oh, wait. Oh, wait.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

We-- the tree needs water as well.

#### TIM

The tree does also need water. That is true.

#### HELEN

Yes. Okay, so Pilchards and Unal are trying to find the bridge having become friends.

#### TIM

Mm...

#### BEN

Ehhh... Found a mutual accord.

__Helen: [laughs]__ Became acquaintances.

#### TIM

Friends of circumstance, should I say.

#### LYDIA

Could we watch it from...

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

Right, from--

#### HELEN

Yes!

#### BEN

Shmerr's perspective.

#### TIM

From Shmerr's perspective, yeah yeah.

#### HELEN

Okay. Shmerr, you're watching these two try, attempt to find the bridge.

##### [SFX: breathing in a space suit]

#### SHMERR

Captain's log: I find myself looking out to the stars and considering our journey out towards them. Not just as a metaphor for the expansion of life and sentience throughout the universe but also it's sort of like looking at a big empty spreadsheet. It's just glorious and awe inspiring. But I digress. I find myself outside the bridge now observing my two lieutenants, the one- what has all the legs __[Lydia chuckles]__ and the one who I'm now cheerfully calling "White Board". __[laughter]__ White Board and Many Legs seem to be getting along. They are efficient if somewhat distant from one another in the room, but I'm sure that is fine. I notice that White Board appears to be spooling up the engines which is encouraging. Of course, I am quite literally on the outside of our ship with no way to brace myself against the acceleration but I'm sure that they have already considered this __[laughter]__ before they would launch such a massive acceleration in such a way. Meanwhile, Many Legs appears to be at the nav console. In a lot of ways, I, I like to think of Many Legs and White Board as my dream team. __[laughter]__ It's clear that under my guidance and my, uh, hands-off management--oh, listen to me! I'm a regular anarchist--um, they are, they are proceeding in a way that could only be considered exceptional. So, with that in mind, I'm going to actually hold on under the assumption that I'm going to-- __[static noise]__

##### [Helen gasps]

#### TIM

Dangerous.

#### LYDIA

Mm.

#### HELEN

Danger?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### ALEX

That was up to you.

#### TIM

We're, we're accelerating and he's on the outside of the ship and he's just about to grab on.

#### HELEN

Ooh! Oh, such danger.

#### TIM

I don't know how the physics of it works. You know, there's, there's no air resistance.

#### BEN

I mean, we're, we're flying a giant tree, so...

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### BEN

The physics can, uh, can take a hike on this one.

#### TIM

Eh, fair enough.

#### HELEN

Yes they can.

#### ALEX

Fun fact: as long as he's on the nose of the ship and that's the direction it's traveling, it'll be fine.

#### LYDIA

It's fine.

#### TIM

It'll be fine.

#### LYDIA

I was surprised you didn't have them hook up.

#### ALEX

I was very tempted but I also didn't--

#### HELEN

Yeah, I could hear it in your voice.

#### ALEX

--I didn't want to force that.

#### TIM

No.

#### ALEX

You know. Some romances take time. Some are entirely moisture driven. And others are, are forged in the fires of adv-- adversarial conflict.

#### LYDIA

And some happen when you accelerate and then you tumble into each other's arms.

#### TIM

"Oh, I've fallen. Oh your eyes."

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

I wouldn't want to force it. Let it happen. Let it happen.

#### HELEN

Well Tim.

#### TIM

I think we should do a scene in, in the bridge then __[Lydia snorts]__ seeing as this--

__Alex: [in a mocking romantic tune]__ Bow, bow, bow, bow!

#### BEN

It's "date me brother" again, Tim.

#### TIM

No. No. We are not that well acquainted as characters. It's not going there. __[Ben chuckles]__ So, uh, uh, Deraldio Pilchards and-- I'm generally having a bad-- hard time--

#### BEN

Commander!

#### TIM

Commander--

#### BEN

Unal!

#### TIM

U-- Unal.

#### BEN

Manspray!

#### TIM

It's because I've written it down as "Ural" like the Ural mountains and so...

#### BEN

It's Unal like the Unal mountains.

#### TIM

Like the Unal mountains. __[chuckles]__

##### [Helen laughs]

#### TIM

Right.

#### LYDIA

Named after those famous mountains.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### LYDIA

Ironically on the planet Urinal.

##### [laughter]

__Tim: [mimicking Unal]__ It causes so much damn confusion.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### BEN

But it's tradition!

#### TIM

Yeah. So, we, we have started to engage the ship and accelerate towards our, our destination.

#### UNAL

I say, did you hear some sort of thump?

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah. There was definitely something clatterin' across the hull at some point.

#### UNAL

Alright, well. Ship. Ship!

#### SHIP

Yes?

#### UNAL

Have there been any hull breaches?

#### SHIP

No.

__Unal: (simult.)__ Ah, it was nothing important then.

__Pilchards: (simult.)__ Ah, everything seems fine then.

#### SHIP

All valued crew members are accounted for.

##### [laughter]

#### UNAL

Very good. Thank you.

#### PILCHARDS

Alright, well, wonderful. Now, you know what? I do have a nagging feeling that there was something we are forgetting. I couldn't possibly tell you what it is though.

#### UNAL

Mr. Squeakington!

#### PILCHARDS

Mr. Squeakington. What happened? You went, you went up with Mr. Squeakington to find the extra scanner as you were telling me as we walked here.

##### [laughter]

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

And you never got to the end of the story. And then you just came back in when we were having a situation with Worshiper. What, what happened?

#### UNAL

Yes, unfortunately...

#### BEN

I take my hat off. Hold it on my chest.

#### UNAL

We lost one.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, no.

#### UNAL

Mr. Squeakington went into the fore storage cupboard...

#### PILCHARDS

Right.

#### UNAL

And was taken by the saps therein.

#### PILCHARDS

Ah, no. Mr. Squeakington's a feathered being.

#### UNAL

Exactly.

#### PILCHARDS

Well, what did you do about it?

#### UNAL

Respected their loss.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### ALEX

"I pressed F."

#### UNAL

As any good commander should. Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

No, that--

#### UNAL

Paid my respects.

#### PILCHARDS

You just put your hat back on. Take it back off again. We're not finished.

#### UNAL

Oh, sorry.

#### PILCHARDS

Look, you can't just, like, put a bird in some sap and then go, "ah, whoopsie daisy." __[laughter]__ "Aw, I better just walk away then." You have to, like, try and help it out.

#### UNAL

Well, what you forget about Mr. Squeakington is they were an interdimensional being.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

Um, and prior to this, I saw them rip the door of the fore storage cabinet clean off.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah. Yeah.

#### UNAL

So, I thought that they might be able to handle a bit of sap.

#### PILCHARDS

Sure.

#### UNAL

And, uh, I only have one of these uniforms.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, no, I'm no-- I'm noticing an inconsistency in, uh, in your account. You're takin' your hat off and saying, "we lost one."

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

But also assuring me that they're fine and it's all fine.

##### [laughter]

#### UNAL

No no no no no no no no no. No, what I mean is I assumed that it would be all fine.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, you just didn't stick around to find out. __[laughs]__

#### UNAL

Well, no. They, they went in--

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

--and I didn't see them again. Thus, killed in action.

#### PILCHARDS

Nah, this is the problem with you. This is the problem with you, mate. This is exactly what we were, what we were having a barney here 'bout earlier.

#### UNAL

Well, I don't recall.

#### PILCHARDS

You, you don't respect people, do you?

#### UNAL

What? No.

#### PILCHARDS

You don't respect me.

__Unal: [stammers]__ Of course I do.

#### PILCHARDS

You don't respect Mr. Squeak--

#### UNAL

I do-- The hat's off.

#### PILCHARDS

Well, yeah--

#### UNAL

The hat's off!

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

Look, takin' your hat off whilst we-- absolutely--

#### UNAL

Do you want me to lower the hat?

#### PILCHARDS

Well, drop it on the floor and stamp on it as far as I care.

#### UNAL

No, I will never do that to my hat!

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

No, take--

#### UNAL

That's a symbol of my office!

#### PILCHARDS

That will be-- That would, that would prove to me that you do actually care even the slight' bit about your fellow crew members. Take off your hat, throw it on the floor, and step on it. __[Lydia gasps]__ And if you do that, maybe I can push past the fact that you 100% abandoned your crew members at the slightest sign of even a lil' bit of adversity.

#### UNAL

Well, then you'll have to join... __[sighs]__ my hatless army.

#### PILCHARDS

You mean I have to take off my hat too?

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

Okay.

#### TIM

I gently reach up to my stylish bowler.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Which you've been wearing this whole time.

#### TIM

It's half rotted.

#### UNAL

We, we should drop the hat together.

#### PILCHARDS

On the count of three.

#### UNAL

And then through that, a bond of brotherhood.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Hot!

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BEN

Awwwwwwwwww...

#### TIM

A band of brotherhood.

#### HELEN

Brotherhood?!

#### TIM

The fact that you think that's hot says more about you than us.

#### BEN

It's been called though. __[Lydia laughs]__ It's been called. Next scene!

#### TIM

Next--

#### BEN

Lyd.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### TIM

You monster.

#### HELEN

Lyd's gone. She's gone. __[laughs]__

__Lydia: [laughs]__ Just having a dust bath.

#### TIM

Just havin' a--

#### BEN

What's your next scene though?

#### TIM

Yeah. __[Lydia laughs]__ Pervert.

##### [Lydia and Helen laugh]

#### LYDIA

I-- or should it be Alex watching again?__ [laughs]__

#### TIM

Please, Alex, do the right thing.

##### [Tim and Ben laugh]

#### LYDIA

I'm gonna put this to Alex. He's going to be watching something. Whether it is what was happening below with us two and the unbelieving or it's the bridge.

#### ALEX

Ah, you gotta make the call.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### ALEX

This is your scene.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Which, which one do you prefer to see?

#### LYDIA

Okay, you have to see the one downstairs.

#### ALEX

So this is--?

#### LYDIA

You're seeing--

#### BEN

If you know what we mean.

##### [Helen laugh]

#### LYDIA

The du-- The-- yeah. We cu-- we cut off on "Unbeliever"!

__Helen: [laughs]__ Yes.

##### [SFX: breathing in a space suit]

__Shmerr: [voice shaking with the ship's vibrations]__ I find myself __[laughter]__ enamored with the idea of efficiency and how they've decided it'll run a little bit better with me outside. __[laughter]__ I do notice that in my initial assessment of the crew there is slightly more tension than I initially considered. Namely, the apparently killer robot. __[laughter]__ Retrospectively, I should have addressed this in the initial crew assessments. So, with that in mind, I am keeping an assessment of the situation distantly. I cannot help but notice that at this stage a significant portion of the budgie appears to be smeared on the walls of the-- __[everyone yelps]__ Thankfully, the main body of the budgie appears to have escaped. [__Helen:__ Just got one wing.] But there is now some kind of killer robot which I am choosing to consider a motivational __[laughter]__ action for the team.

#### ALEX

Alex has to stop, he has cramping like every muscle in his torso.

#### BEN

Ah, that's-- I thought that's why you weren't cutting.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Oh, that was incredible!

#### ALEX

Ugh!

#### LYDIA

Way to get stage tortured, man. It's always about that.

#### TIM

Yeah. Live foley.

#### HELEN

Wonderful.

#### TIM

Wonderful.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

Wonderful.

#### LYDIA

Just, yeah, look at him. Look at the dedication there.

#### BEN

I mean, you made a, you made a choice and you stuck with it.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

You did stick with it.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### ALEX

That's the one rule!

#### HELEN

It is!

#### TIM

Yeah, like a bad marriage, you just stuck with it.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, go for it! Go on.

#### HELEN

Yeah. That is a rule that I wrote down on my character sheet. Yeah. If you're interrupting then stick to it.

#### ALEX

Oh yeah.

#### HELEN

Yeah, that's what you said.

#### LYDIA

If you're in a bad marriage--

#### TIM

Stick with it.

#### LYDIA

I'd write that down often.

#### HELEN

Kill the man.

#### TIM

Yeah. You know.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Make it look like an accident.

#### LYDIA

Yep.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Right, the podcast has taken a turn. How do you--

#### BEN

Pour their blood into your fuel pipe and use it to power you for a--

#### HELEN

Lie around in your wedding dress.

#### ALEX

Somehow we've gone from, from, uh, like, marital murder and we trace that back to I was just shaking a bit in a chair.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

#### ALEX

Wow.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### ALEX

Wow.

#### TIM

A lot on our minds today.

##### [Alex laughs]

#### HELEN

Yes. It's actually your turn to frame a scene.

#### ALEX

Right. In that case then, I would like a scene of, uh, Mr. Squeakington joining the rest of the team on the bridge in whatever state they're in.

#### TIM

Should we do that in media res?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### ALEX

Very much so.

#### PILCHARDS

Now, on the count of three, drop the hat.

#### BEN

Uhhhh... We did get called "hot".

#### ALEX

You did get called "hot".

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

Ooh.

#### BEN

So, we have to be caught *in flagrante*.

#### ALEX

I mean, in fairness, __[Lydia laughs]__ you could do exactly the same line.

#### TIM

Must we?

#### ALEX

Just... really close.

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

Right, now you're takin' everything else off. __[Lydia laughs]__ Drop the hat.

#### ALEX

Lydia made it a little weird.

##### [Mr. Squeakington squeaks]

__Pilchards: (simult.)__ Alright-- Woah. Woah.

__Unal: (simult.)__ Woah. Woah. Hello. Eh--

#### PILCHARDS

And that is obviously how you cool down.

#### UNAL

Yes. My uniform slipped.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, it just... slipped off.

#### UNAL

Oh look! All these buttons have fallen off. And my belt came undone.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

Right. Quickly put-- rectify that.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh.

#### UNAL

Um, yes. Mr. Squeakington, you appear to be alive--great--and maimed.

#### LYDIA

Uh, so, ironically you guys might have had your clothes off. Mr. Squeakington is plucked.

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

Wait, did you run in?

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, oh no!

#### LYDIA

He [*sic*] ran in or he hopped in.

#### PILCHARDS

It appears to be a nude bird.

#### LYDIA

And he [*sic*] lost a lot of feathers in the dust/blood, like--

#### ALEX

Extravaganza.

#### LYDIA

Extravaganza happening downstairs.

#### UNAL

Mr.-- Mr. Squeakington, have you no sense of propriety?!

__Alex: [laughs]__ This is the bridge.

#### UNAL

This is the bridge!

__Worshiper 2X7: [muffled]__ Nonbelievers.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

__Worshiper 2X7: [muffled]__ Unbelievers.

#### UNAL

Uh...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

The-- that robot is really problematic!

__Worshiper 2X7: [muffled]__ Nonbelievers. Nonbelievers.

#### PILCHARDS

Uh, alright. Quick, quick action is needed. Let's lock down the bridge to keep the robot out.

__Worshiper 2X7: [muffled]__ Nonbelievers. Nonbelievers. Nonbelievers!

#### UNAL

Okay, I'll press this button. __[beep]__

#### PILCHARDS

Blast doors.

#### SHIP

Bridge sealed.

#### UNAL

Right.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Squeak.

##### [SFX and actor foley of doors close and seal, Worshiper 2X7 trying to get in through the door]

#### UNAL

Um...

#### PILCHARDS

Now, what, what, what happened?

#### ALEX

I will add those in post.

#### HELEN

Okay, good.

#### PILCHARDS

What 'appened, Mr. Squeakington?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Oh, well, I just suggested-- see, I, because I was abandoned cruelly--

##### [laughter]

#### UNAL

Ah, about that--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Uhm...

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, yeah. About that...

#### LYDIA

So, the bird hops in between Many Legs and White Board and is facing--

#### ALEX

'Cause those are their names now!

#### LYDIA

--Many Legs-- Yeah.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

My work is done.

#### LYDIA

He's facing Many Legs completely. I mean, like--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Well, since you're the only one worth addressing, since I was so cruelly abandoned, [__Unal:__ Uh, well--] I was stuck in sap [__Pilchards:__ Uh-huh.] and then my feathers, [__Pilchards:__ Yeah.] uh, so urgently dust bath. So, dust then bath then that worked so well, I suggested--eep!--that, uh, instead of--eep!--the robot seeking--eep!--moisture, as they were saying they--eep!--urgently--eep!--needed to do, that they use some of the dust in the dusty pit.

#### ALEX

Bear in mind, the entire time of this: __[imitating the banging on the door]__ boomph!

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### PILCHARDS

Hang on, hang on.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

So--

#### PILCHARDS

The dusty pit?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

And then--

#### PILCHARDS

You mean, you--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

--she got angry and then *smeared* me on the walls.

#### PILCHARDS

In the dusty pit?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yeah. So now it's a, it's a dusty, bloody, sappy pit.

__Pilchards: [outraged]__ You mean you mussed up my dusty pit?!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Well, I mean, there's n--

#### PILCHARDS

That's where I keep all my stuff!

#### LYDIA

Gestures sort of with her wings but there's very lil' feather in the way. Feathers attached to the wings right now.

#### UNAL

Deraldio! Deraldio, please! Please!

#### PILCHARDS

Nah! No, this is--

#### UNAL

Please. Darling-- __[laughter]__ I mean, Deraldio! __[stammers]__ Uh, Lieutenant Pilchards.

#### PILCHARDS

Look, I am just a lil' bit angry. That's where I kept all my plunder, my loot, my booty, my mints!

#### UNAL

No, you ate those.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh, yeah. But anyway, you mussed it up with your blood and your sap and your feathers.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Trust me, I'd be much happier with my blood on the inside, too!

#### UNAL

Actually, thinking about it, as much as I enjoy this conversation, [__Mr Squeakington:__ Eep!] we're all looking this way--

__Pilchards: (simult.)__ Yeah.

__Mr Squeakington: (simult.)__ Eep.

#### UNAL

--I turned the engines on--

__Pilchards: (simult.)__ Uh-huh.

__Mr Squeakington: (simult.)__ Yep.

#### UNAL

Who's driving?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eahhh!

#### PILCHARDS

Uh...

#### BEN

Dangerous!

#### TIM

Danger.

##### [Worshiper 2X7's attempts to open door end]

#### HELEN

Ooh-ho-ho! So dangerous! Isn't it your go?

#### BEN

It is.

#### HELEN

Ben, what do you want to see?

#### BEN

Uhhhhh...

#### ALEX

A massive explosion!

#### BEN

Wellllll... So, I would like one of Shmerr watching the comet fast approaching.

#### ALEX

Yeah. __[Lydia chuckles]__ I'm on board with that.

#### BEN

From the outside of the ship.

__[__

__Shmerr: [voice shaking with the ship's vibrations]__ Captain's log supplemental--

#### BEN

'Kay, just very quickly, remember, I didn't make him do this.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, no one made him.

#### ALEX

Oh no, it's just, it's required. It's required.

#### LYDIA

Yep.

##### [SFX: breathing in a space suit]

__Shmerr: [voice shaking with ship's vibrations]__ Captain's log supplemental: I have nothing but pride and respect for the navigator Many Legs in deciding to accelerate full force at the comet. __[Lydia laughs]__ The increased speed has allowed us to arrive at our destination in, what I estimate to be, at least three seconds spare. And in a lot of ways, if that isn't worth my death, I don't know what is. __[laughter]__ And so this will probably be my last entry. I would just like to thank Many Legs, White Board, Baldy, and Killer Inceptive Robot. __[laughter]__ While serving with me, without their assistance I could never have guided this ship into a comet __[laughter]__ for some reason. I'm not sure why we're aiming at the comet, but we got there fast. And if that isn't a win, I don't know what is. __[static]__

#### TIM

So, is it the case that you don't even know about the moisture--

##### [Helen laughs]

#### ALEX

I have no idea! __[laughter]__ I have no idea! I've just twigged that we're aiming for a comet and we got there quick.

##### [laughter continues]

#### HELEN

Oh, my--

#### LYDIA

Dangerous, I guess.

#### TIM

Yeah, dangerous.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Dangerous again. It's all dangerous.

#### BEN

Hey, Helen-- __[chuckles]__

#### HELEN

You know what? I'd like to see a scene with Squeakington, Unal, and Pilchards all panicking as they see a comet approaching.

##### [SFX: alarm blaring]

##### [Mr. Squeakington starts squeaking in alarm]

#### PILCHARDS

Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

#### UNAL

Oh, bloody hell.

#### PILCHARDS

Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

#### UNAL

Um, right. No.

#### PILCHARDS

Where are the brakes on this?

#### UNAL

Hang on, I'm pressing the go button.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eh, no. Not that--

__Ship: [beep]__ Accelerating.

#### UNAL

No. No no no no.

__Ship: [beep]__ Accelerating.

#### UNAL

I want to press it backwards.

__Ship: [beep]__ Accelerating.

#### PILCHARDS

Stop doing it, you moron.

__Ship: [beep]__ Accelerating.

#### TIM

I, uh, I--

#### LYDIA

Just starts attacking a speaker.

#### TIM

I lunge for a brake lever.

__Alex: [laughing]__ 'Cause there's a hand brake in space!

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

Yeah, but it's a giant branch.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah.

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

Maybe if I pull this.

#### TIM

I pull the hand brake branch lever.

#### SHIP

Brakes engaged. Deceleration in T-minus 13 minutes.

##### [Aww's]

#### BEN

Oh no!

#### PILCHARDS

We're in our last moments together. I think we could all agree that you, Ural, are, um--

#### UNAL

It's Unal.

#### PILCHARDS

That you U--

#### BEN

Nope, out of time.

#### TIM

Aw.

##### [Alex laughs, Mr. Squeakington squeaks]

#### ALEX

Cut. Danger! Boom.

##### [explosion]

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

Uh, it's not my turn.

#### BEN

Tim, it's your scene.

#### HELEN

Yeah. It's your scene, Tim.

#### TIM

Wh-- Out of time, boom.

#### BEN

No, out of time, cut.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### BEN

All I said was out of time. We could have concurrences. It doesn't have to be chronological.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Okay, yeah, well let's, let's have a concurrent scene. So, as that, that previous scene was taking--

#### ALEX

Also, you're assuming a lot of people breathe oxygen and, quite frankly, that's your problem, not ours.

#### TIM

Yeah, that's my, that's my privilege.

#### BEN

Well, we never really established the atmosphere in this ship so.

#### TIM

Yeah. It's *all* just nitrogen. __[laughter]__ Mm, tasty nitrogen. Try some today!

#### ALEX

Good for trees!

#### TIM

Good for trees!__ [laughter]__ Um... __[laughs]__ Right.

#### HELEN

So, what scene would you like?

#### TIM

Um, so the scene will be the other side of the blast doors and Worshiper 2X7 trying to devise a way of entering the bridge, not knowing that the comet is soon to be a squashy, hot friend.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Well, first cold then very, very much hot.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

Oh yeah.

#### HELEN

Hmm, let's think.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Engaging rams.

##### [sound of rams unfolding]

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

Oh, no.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Engaging additional rams.

##### [sound of more rams unfolding]

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Engaging corkscrew.

##### [corkscrew whirring]

##### [laughter]

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Attack. Attack. Attack.

#### SHIP

I would just like to wish you luck in converting all of the squishy inmates into fluid.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Thank you, Ship.

#### SHIP

I'm just saying, if you want to share it out, I'm sure we could get along together.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Moisture?

#### SHIP

Moisture.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Moisture!

#### SHIP

Moisture.

#### WORSHIPER 2X7

Moisture.

#### SHIP

Moisture.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

Cut.

#### BEN

Cut.

#### LYDIA

Cut!

##### [explosion]

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

I'm so proud of us that no one said hot.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

It's only 'cause I was in the scene. If I was out of it, that'd been so hot, so fast.

#### HELEN

Okay. I--

__Tim: (simult.)__ "Moisture? Moisture. Moisture? Ah, moisture!"

__Ben: (simult.)__ Hey, how 'bout--?

__Helen: (simult.)__ Moisture.

#### ALEX

I just want it on the record, the second that Helen's running the show, this, this got hot! Got hot and steamy!

#### TIM

Hot in Cleveland!

#### HELEN

That's why I'm not allowed to run Monster Hearts. __[laughs]__ I think we have time for one more scene.

#### ALEX

Whose, whose turn is it to call?

#### LYDIA

Oh, it's me.

#### HELEN

It's Lydia's turn.

#### TIM

Lydia.

#### LYDIA

Cut to...

#### ALEX

Shmerr.

#### HELEN

Shmerr.

#### LYDIA

Shmerr.

#### TIM

Yeah.

__Lydia: [haltingly]__ Shmerr standing on a scrap of ship hull in a cloud of ice particles, spinning around with only a ship's log recorder in their hand.

#### ALEX

Thankfully I don't need to shake. The acceleration's done at least. I can--

#### LYDIA

Yeah yeah yeah, just floating.

#### BEN

But it's very cold so you're shivering.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Don't you dare!

#### LYDIA

It is very cold, Alex.

#### ALEX

I-I'm in my suit. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

It's a cold suit.

#### BEN

Your suit has a leak.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### ALEX

Oh definitely. Definitely.

##### [SFX: breathing in a space suit and low alarm beeping rapidly]

#### SHMERR

Captain's log supplemental: I, Shmerr, of the dissolium collective do claim this comet __[laughter]__ as a property of me and would like to pay my respects to the dedicated crew that sacrificed their lives so nobly that I might obtain my personal mission.

To Many Legs: he had many legs. __[laughter]__ I never heard his voice, but I liked to think it was bassy in a comforting manner. Certainly, White Board seemed to think so. __[laughter]__

White Board: you were always so efficient apparently at everything apart from people management. But that's okay. Not everyone's as charismatic as Shmerr. __[laughter]__

And then Baldy: [__Lydia:__ Squeak.] I'm so sorry, Baldy, that you had to lose your feathers in the pursuit of our, our shared dream that I presume you share. __[laughter]__ But take heart from knowing that as you bounced around the bridge like a ping-pong ball in a washing machine you managed to hit the escape pod button and at least sent some message of our success out into the void.

And so, I bring myself full circle to Incenti-bot. I've, I've, I've called you Incenti-bot because that, Incenti-bot, is what you are. In a lot of ways, you were the most valuable member of my crew. Whenever I was thinking, "How? How will I get them to the bridge to get me to a comet apparently?" __[laughter]__ Incenti-bot was there seducing, killing, harvesting for moisture *even as the impact was happening*. __[laughter]__

And so, I would like to close this log. Comfortable in the knowledge that this comet has been claimed. And as I see that bloody awful tree buggering off, __[laughter]__ finally I can rest calm and happy knowing that, in a some small way, we all made a difference. But mostly, mostly it was me, Shmerr.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

Cut!

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Wonderful. I think that's a lovely note to end on.

#### LYDIA

Beautiful.

#### ALEX

Hot!

#### TIM

Hot!

#### BEN

Hot! Hot.

#### TIM

Ooh, sexy isolation! __[laughter]__ Urgh, leave me on my own! Argh!

#### ALEX

Wh-what a curvy chunk of ice.

#### HELEN

Ah, don't. The Magnus fandom will get a hold of that.

#### BEN

Now we-- yeah, now we're gettin' a crossover.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

Ohh, I'm just on my own with a tape recorder. Ooooh!

#### BEN

Oh, no. On your own just with his own beard.

#### LYDIA

Oh no, it is... genuinely a bad thing.

#### HELEN

Right. Did we all have fun?

#### LYDIA

Yes.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

No. No, it was terrible. It was awful.

#### TIM

No no. Hated it.

#### ALEX

I did not interact with a single character. If that isn't an RPG win, I don't know what is.

#### HELEN

Very good. We're very proud of you, Alex.

#### LYDIA

Yes.

#### HELEN

Ah, well, I hope you had fun as well, __[laughter]__ listeners. Dearest listeners.

#### TIM

Dearest listeners.

#### BEN

Yeah, I guess, uh, one thing is you can... get Vast & Starlit if you google it.

#### HELEN

Oh!

#### ALEX

Yes.

#### BEN

And--

#### HELEN

Yeah, genuinely but you should also pay for it 'cause you should always pay for your games.

#### BEN

Yes. It, it is a pay-what-you-want and it does say on the website that you can preview it for free. [__Helen:__ Mm-hmm.] But, yeah, it is pay-what-you-want, so if you like it, pay for it. [__Lydia:__ Yay.] Even if it's, like, fifty cents or a dollar or a pound.

#### TIM

If you use--

#### LYDIA

Or a euro.

#### ALEX

One hundred pounds!

#### BEN

Or one hundred pounds.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, 'cause let's be honest, what will a pound be worth by the time this is broadcast.

#### BEN

That's true. One million pounds.

#### HELEN

Oh my gosh.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

Right. One discarded car part that you can trade for some mystery meat.

##### [chuckles]

#### HELEN

Several plastic bags which have shot up in value.

__Lydia: [laughs]__ Yeah.

#### ALEX

It's all gone to such a strange, strange place.

#### LYDIA

Just filled with tap water.

##### [Helen laughs]

__Tim: [laughing]__ Plastic Sainsbury's bags filled with tap water.

#### BEN

Fifteen of Theresa May's career.

__Helen: [laughs]__ Worthless, Ben! They're all worthless!

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Bye guys.

#### ALL

Bye!

#### ALEX

Hot!
