#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [sound of chairs sliding around, followed by door whooshing]

#### HARTRO

_(slightly out of breath)_ Ah, hey, David 7. Ah, [__DAVID:__ Hartro!] there we go. I was here, [__DAVID:__ Uh--] I'm here. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Are we less late? We're less [__DAVID:__ N--] late.

#### DAVID

No, yeah, I think you're roughly about exactly the same amount of late as you usually are.

#### HARTRO

David 7, are we less late? __[panting slightly for air]__

#### DAVID

I don't-- I'm-- I'm-- [__HARTRO:__ We're less late.] Maybe, but by a few seconds, yes, maybe.

#### HARTRO

Whoo-hooo. Yeaaaah.

#### DAVID

W-Where's Trexel?

#### HARTRO

__[a loooong sigh]__ Let me catch my breath. Ah, yeah.

#### DAVID

I-- S-So-- Where's Trexel?

#### HARTRO

__[sighs]__ Oh, he's, he's in that slide there. __[laughing]__

#### DAVID

Right. And is he, is he, is he coming down at all? Like, is he, is he stuck in there? Or is it just, like, a really long slide?

#### HARTRO

Uh, it's a really long, intricate, swirly slide, and he's somewhere between the top at that ladder there--

##### [the sound of Trexel's screaming starts as a low, distant hum with the occasional clanging of metal, and gains volume with time]

#### DAVID

Okay, right, th-- Wow, that is a-- That is a big, oh--

#### IMOGEN

*(overlapping)* __[beep]__ I could close the door and crush the pipe, if you would like. Just a suggestion.

#### HARTRO

He's getting-- he's getting closer.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Yeah, no, this is a long-- it's a long... long sli--

##### [David is cut off by Trexel crash landing]

#### TREXEL

Yeah ha ha ohh! [__HARTRO:__ Oh!] Again! Again, again! __[retreating footsteps]__

#### DAVID

No, no, no, no, no, Trexel, come back!

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ No, he's going again.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Oh he's-- No. You've made it too fun.

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* This is, this is, this is how it's been the last five hours. The thing is, I found him so far away. It's taken me this long to get back here. __[sighs]__

##### [Trexel's screaming descent begins to crescendo again]

#### DAVID

So is this-- Is this slide just something you've taken from, sort of, a public space, or did you build this slide--?

##### [Trexel crash lands with a gleeful cackle]

#### TREXEL

Again, once more! __[retreating footsteps]__

#### DAVID

Okay, Trexel, stop, stop. Stop, no-- Oh, he's gone.

#### HARTRO

Oh, just let him. Anyway, I can stop him from going up. I have a way of retracting the ladder here. If I just go-- __[tapping sound, and then the ladder retracts]__ There we go. That'll him stop him doing it again.

#### TREXEL

__[approaching foosteps]__ *(dejectedly)* I got to the ladder and it was gone. Where's the ladder gone? [__HARTRO:__ Uhhh.] The ladder was my friend. It took me to Slide Town.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ You have been barred from Slide Town for the safety of residents.

##### [Trexel sniffs]

#### HARTRO

Trexel?

#### TREXEL

The slide's over now. It was the best thing I've ever had.

#### DAVID

You're at work now.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* I know.

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* You're at work now.

#### TREXEL

I'm not at work, I'm in *hell*. I'm in hell because I'm without slide.

#### DAVID

And you're saying slide was better than Percy?

#### TREXEL

_(high-pitched)_ I'm not saying slide was better than-- Why would you be so hostile to me, David? I just enjoyed a thing.

#### DAVID

You used a superlative.

#### TREXEL

I j-- Look, now, actually-- Let's, let's inspect-- No, let's inspect y-your motivations here. I enjoyed a *thing*. [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] And your immediate reaction was to say, 'Oh, so you don't love something else that's important to you.'

#### DAVID

Yeah?

#### HARTRO

Oooh, that's one point for David. I'm gonna start a little tally mark here.

#### DAVID

Thank you.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* What? No, no, let's-- What, a-what, just because he's one up on the sass marker?

#### HARTRO

Well, yeah, I think we should have a sass... uh, bit of a sass, uh, tally [__TREXEL:__ A sass-off?] here going-- Yeah, a sass off.

#### DAVID

Okay, yeah. Yeah, sass-off, I could sass-off.

#### TREXEL

A s-- A sass-tastic sass-off. Well, you s-- You, you, you, David 7, [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] are a worthless, slimy clone who has never achieved anything, and never will achieve anything, due to your limitations in social standing.

_(singing)_ Sass-off! You've been sassed by the best, sass-off!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Less 'sass', more 'explaining an inequality.'

#### DAVID

My limitation being *Trexel*.

#### HARTRO and TREXEL

Oooooooohhhh!

#### DAVID

_(overlapping, joining in)_ Ohhhhhhhh!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Sassed back! Back to the sass!

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Flipped the sass back!

#### TREXEL

_(singsong)_ Get y-- Y'got sassed right on your ass! It's sass back! _(normally)_ Right, how about this. Try this on: if you were a fruit, you'd be a lame apple. Burn.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Nope.

#### DAVID

I think that's, uh, another, another one for David.

#### HARTRO

Yeah. 0-3 for David. __[writing sounds]__

#### TREXEL

If you were a-- If you were a holiday, you'd be a camping trip to somewhere your parents chose! Buuuuurn-sassed!

#### DAVID

How would you know? Your parents never took you camping.

#### HARTRO

Oooooooooh!! Tsssss.

#### TREXEL

That's not sass. That's mean.

#### HARTRO

Put it up here, David, that was a nice one.

#### DAVID

Number three, here we go!

#### HARTRO

No, four! 'Cause there was the other one.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Four!

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* You don't even have parents. At least I had some before they died for some reason.

#### DAVID

Well no, I-IMOGEN's my, my, my mummy.

#### TREXEL

Nope! That's just something you *think* is the case. [__DAVID:__ No, it's-- I'm pretty sure--] Actually, you're *alone* in the universe.

#### DAVID

Well, I'm, I'm in a room with you two right now, just--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Just to say, I am not your mother, and that was uncomfortable for everyone.

#### TREXEL

Emotionally alone in the universe!

#### DAVID

I mean...

#### HARTRO

Hmmm.

#### DAVID

Aren't we all really just emotionally alone in this--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* None of my sass is landing. Oh, it's just--e-every time I do some sass, he's all like, 'Well, you know, I'm not sure I agree.' You know, you can't sass with that. This isn't a sass-back, this is a sass-sack. [__DAVID:__ Oh--] Just eating up all my sass, and then chucking the sass over its shoulder so it's in the sack. Taking it to market, selling it to a sass merchant.

#### DAVID

Well, Trexel, you merely adopted the sass. I was born in it. [__TREXEL and HARTRO:__ Ohhhh.] I was *moulded* by the sass.

#### TREXEL

You do sass as a service. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] Sass!

#### HARTRO

You can't just say "sass" and expect to get a point, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Saaa*aaass?* Sass! Saaaass.

#### HARTRO

I'm gonna g-- I'm gonna round it to five. __[scribbles, as Trexel begins to hiss-chant "sass"]__ The sass is definitely in David 7's corner. And I'm gonna give myself six.

#### DAVID

What?

#### HARTRO

Just because of, well... I mean, look at me. __[chuckles]__

#### DAVID

Okay...

#### TREXEL

Sassy Hartro.

#### DAVID

Right. Alright, well--

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* But I'll keep the pen here. I mean, any sass at any time I can definitely tally.

#### DAVID

Yep, sure, fine. Okay, so, are we, are we good for the brief now? We good?

#### HARTRO

I'm born good for the brief.

##### [pneumatic tube hisses]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### TREXEL

Yep, and when you least expect it, I'll bring the sass cannons. Sass-bam!

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### HARTRO

We'll be waiting. Mm-hmm.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I'm not holding my breath. For a start, I don't breathe.

#### DAVID

"Count Eugenia Rutalowska. Rutalowska?" I don't know.

#### TREXEL

Can't even say names. Sass Cannon! Point for Sass-Trexel.

#### DAVID

No, I was just, I was just trying to be-- I was just trying to be reasonable. I, I realise that I might not pronounce the name correctly, so I just wanted to allow for--

##### [Trexel groans loudly]

#### HARTRO

Yeah, he's being thoughtful. He's being [__DAVID:__ Yeah!] professional.

#### TREXEL

Okay, fine, yeah, yeah. _(mutters)_ I see how it is, I see how it is. It's a sass-spiracy.

#### DAVID

I'm going to go phonetic: "Ruka-- Rutalowska." Apologies.

#### HARTRO

__[burbles]__ That's what I would have guessed, David 7. I would have-- "Rutalowska."

#### TREXEL

Phonetic? More like *pathetic*.

#### DAVID

Actually, that was a reasonably good bit of wordplay, I'll give you that.

#### TREXEL

I mean, right?

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't effective, and I don't feel bad, but it was a reasonably good wordplay.

#### TREXEL

I was impressed with me.

#### HARTRO

I think David 7 actually has to feel bad for the sass to count?

#### DAVID

No, no. Give him half a point. Give him a pity point.

#### HARTRO

Really? Okay.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ A pity point.

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* We'll him hal-- We'll put him on the board.

#### DAVID

Yeah. We'll give him a pity half.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* I don't like how this has happened, but I'll take the half-point.

#### HARTRO

There we go. "Rutalowski?"

#### DAVID

"Rutalowska."

#### HARTRO

"Rutalowska."

#### DAVID

"Rutalowska." Count Eugenia Rutalowska. He's "External Seeking Wisdom", and he's writing to us, uh, from I assume his place of business. "Count's Corporeal Carpet Cleaning Company."

#### TREXEL

Ah! Count's Corporeal Carpet Cleaning Company. Now I've used them many a time whilst I've got blood in the shag.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Never speak again.

#### TREXEL

Shag carpeting, you understand.

#### DAVID

Yes, no, I did understand. S'just...

#### TREXEL

You know, they've got a saying. D'you know what it is?

#### DAVID

No.

#### HARTRO

What is it?

#### TREXEL

"If we can't get it out, no-one count." Now, it used to be "You can count on us," and then they changed it, but they changed the wrong words. But I like it. It's got a certain *je ne sais* count.

#### HARTRO

Hmmm.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, the Count... he says, "Someone sh--"

#### TREXEL

One.

#### DAVID

He--

#### TREXEL

Two.

#### DAVID

No, you're just counting.

#### TREXEL

Three. Is this sass? I feel like this is sass. I feel like I'm doing some sass.

#### HARTRO

I think this is appropriate sass. I'm going to give [__TREXEL:__ Yeahhh!] you a point for that.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Sassing you with the numbers!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No, that was not sass! That was talk back!

#### HARTRO

David, you were thrown off.

#### DAVID

Yeah, but that's--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Yeah! It affected you emotionally. Put it on the board! Back-chat wins the day.

#### DAVID

It didn't affect me emotionally. It just-- It, it affected my ability to say words because you were talking over me.

#### TREXEL

David, it's getting sad now. Just accept that you have lost.

#### DAVID

_(mumbling)_ It's just unprofessional.

#### HARTRO

You're still way ahead.

#### DAVID

Oh, I know, but it's the principle of the thi-- Anyway, the Count's Corporeal Carpet Cleaning Company. The Count has asked, "Someone has shipped copious casks of cabernet in the guise of carpet cleaner."

#### HARTRO

Hmmm.

#### DAVID

That's--

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* Mystery!

#### TREXEL

Right, that's not a-- That's not a problem.

#### DAVID

Well it--

#### TREXEL

That's a wonderful gift you've given yourself.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Well, no, it is a problem.

#### TREXEL

'Oh, I've got carpet cleaner. Oh, wait, it's cabernet! Glug glug glug,' then you don't know what's happening for three days. It's a-- It's a-- It's an ideal situation.

#### DAVID

Let me hit you with an alternative scenario.

#### HARTRO

Hit us!

#### TREXEL

Don't ever hit me. Don't ever hit me. Caress me with this argument.

#### DAVID

Yes. I, I, I will never hit you because I think you will die.

#### TREXEL

You know what? I think it too. I've seen what you've done to walls.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

I don't wanna be a smashed wall.

#### HARTRO

I want you to intellectually sock me.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Sock it to our brains!

#### DAVID

_(upset)_ Don't use that *word* with my *brain*!

##### [Trexel and Hartro begin to repeat alarmed 'ohs']

#### TREXEL

Hartro!

#### HARTRO

I, I'm-- Oh-- I'm just gonna give myself a point for sass because... __[chortles]__

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Well that's--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ My brain has never socked anybody! There will be no socks near my mind, my body, or my soul! Damn these socks! Damn these socks to hell!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Warning: clone temperature rising.

#### TREXEL

Hartro. Just want to check something. You've got your craft box again. _(lowers voice)_ I just want to check: you've not got any, y'know?

#### HARTRO

_(whispering)_ Sock puppets?

#### TREXEL

_(whispering)_ Sock puppets in there, have you?

#### HARTRO

_(whispering)_ I, I do. But I'm-- They're, they're near the bottom.

#### TREXEL

_(whispering)_ Just...well, dig one out and slip it to me. I've got some, got--

#### HARTRO

_(whispering, overlap)_ That's so *mean*.

#### TREXEL

_(whispering)_ Well-- I wanna get up on that sass board.

#### HARTRO

__[as she digs through her jingling crafts bag]__ *(whispering)* H-here you go, here you go, here you go. I wanna see how this plays out. __[Trexel chuckles]__

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Wh-wh-whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever you're talking about, I'm gonna, I'm gonna--

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* Oh, no, we're talking about the brief.

#### DAVID

I'm going to present you...

##### [Hartro hums assent that dissolves into barely contained giggles]

#### DAVID

Present you with an alternative...

#### TREXEL

Yeah?

#### DAVID

Scenario.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk, still in the throes of laughter)_ Okay, do it.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Please.

#### HARTRO

Tr-Try.

#### TREXEL

Please.

#### DAVID

_(muttering)_ Don't like your giggle. Anyway. No. "Hello. I--"

#### HARTRO

Hello!

#### TREXEL

"This is rubbish!" __[jingling sounds]__ Who was that?

#### HARTRO

__[faux gasp]__ What? I heard that too!

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* "This is rubbish, I hate it!" Who is-- What's that? [__DAVID:__ Why are you--] Who's saying that?

#### DAVID

What are you--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* "This is all rubbish, and I hate it!" __[puppet jingling]__ It's Julius C. Sockenstuff __[Hartro gasps]__ "Hello!!!"

#### DAVID

_(roaring)_ No!

##### [Trexel screams in agony as jingling rings out]

#### HARTRO

He's crushing your hand!

#### TREXEL

_(anguished)_ My hand!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Your comeuppance is sweet, sweet nectar to me.

#### TREXEL

_(pleading as David squeezes the puppet and his hand)_ Please, David, let go of my hand!

#### DAVID

_(growling)_ Julius C. Sockenstuff, is it?

#### HARTRO

D... David. David!

#### DAVID

Why, how about Julius C. Deadenstuff?! [__TREXEL:__ No!] Hi-ya!

#### TREXEL

_(in pain)_ Ooooooooooooh!

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* David, David! Trexel's hand's under there!

#### TREXEL

He's just socked me with extreme prejudice! I am now a nude and battered hand. Ashamed. Ashamed.

#### DAVID

Julius, is it? __[puppet jingles]__ "Yes." Not so verbose now that your skeleton has been destroyed. Well, how about you have one of *these!* __[puppet jingles, then ripping sounds and Hartro gasps]__

#### TREXEL

I hope that sock puppet wasn't important to you, Hartro. Because it's now just sock shreds.

#### HARTRO

__[sighs]__ It's for team building... and business-related enterprise.

#### TREXEL

Oh, so basically worthless, then. Not to worry. Um, David--

#### DAVID

Wow, one for Trexel!

#### TREXEL

You need to work-- You need to-- Yeah, that really, you need to work through some stuff because I expected to, you know, like razz you with that sock puppet? I felt like I got you right where you lived.

#### DAVID

You know how I feel about socks, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

But *why?* Why do you feel this way about socks?

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* They're disgusting. They're monstrous.

#### HARTRO

I think this is a really, really good train of thought. I think this would be the perfect time, David 7, for us to delve into this. This is obviously something that's bothering you, and I think it's getting in the way of your work.

#### DAVID

Well there's nothing-- No, there's nothing too deep-seated about it. The only valid piece of clothing is the onesie, and all a sock is, is it's like a 'whuh.' If you, if you, if you start from the bottom, and you go up, and you see a onesie, you're like, 'Onesie, lovely!' If you look at a sock, 'Whuh.' This is not even anything.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* So you feel like it's a, it's an unfinished onesie. A betrayal of the idea of a onesie by its very existence.

#### HARTRO

A gesture of a onesie.

#### DAVID

It's not even a h-- Look, at least a thigh-high boot is sort of a 'Waaaah.' [__HARTRO:__ Oh, I like a nice thigh-high, I do.] You know, you almost get the one. Some trousers is a 'one.' And a shirt's obviously a 'sie.' So you know, you've got a 'onesie,' which is everything. A 'sie' for the top, a, a 'one' for your bottom, a wh--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* What d-- How do you feel about hats? What's a hat, then?

#### HARTRO

Yeah.

#### DAVID

Oh, that's-- Well, ac-- __[stammering]__ The punctuation of the body. You know, you're wearing a--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Oh, so it-- Certain hat's a question mark. "Onesie?" So, other hats, exclamation. "Onesie!"

#### DAVID

Precisely. Precisely.

#### TREXEL

Or... a semi-colon. "Onesie;" and then you have a list of things.

#### DAVID

Yes, and you're inviting people to come up and ask you, "Hey, so what about this onesie that you've got?"

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* What about it? List, list things to me with commas.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Precisely. So, socks, socks are uncomfortable. They get gooey unreasonably quickly.

#### HARTRO

I think yours get gooey.

#### DAVID

They are useless, only covering your feet.

#### HARTRO

They're great for training purposes.

#### DAVID

Waste of resources. There's a perfectly good glove. Why are people sock puppets? What about a glove puppet? [__HARTRO:__ Hmm.] Gloves are great, they keep your hands warm.

#### TREXEL

Well, you put a sock over your hand, it's sort of like a mitten.

#### DAVID

Then use a mitten!

#### TREXEL

Ooh, he's got a point. Hartro, he's got a point.

#### HARTRO

He does.

#### TREXEL

You know what, I'd like to-- I'd like to sign this up to some sort of deep-seated trauma by the fact that his skin is his clothes and therefore his identity, but he's making some pretty good points about socks just being a bit rubbish.

#### HARTRO

Well I [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] think he's got a pretty bulletproof definition of hate.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Please do not buy into this gooey clone's onesie fundamentalism.

#### HARTRO

I don't think I'll be wearing socks.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ One for David.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ One for David. Okay.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah, put it up there.

#### DAVID

Point for them.

#### TREXEL

Now, let's get back to this brief.

#### HARTRO

What?

#### TREXEL

I feel like we should get back to this brief. We've done the thing, we've done the that, __[David stammers in confusion]__ there's the sass points let's just get back to--

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Why?

#### HARTRO

Wait, something's, something's not right.

#### TREXEL

No, everything-- it's j-- I just-- I just-- I was-- I was a little bit het up after the audio-visual experience that was Hartro's last brief submission, and I very much saw that David over here sided with Hartro, so I felt like I would try and, you know, come back with a new effort. Fighting fit. __[Hartro sighs]__ See if I can get something over the line that people don't [__DAVID:__ Okay.] think is a pathetic embarrassment.

#### HARTRO

So, I inspired you, did I? Heh. I have that effect.

#### TREXEL

No, no, no, no, you-- It's not inspiration, it's more sort of like a competitive hate.

#### DAVID

Well alright-- Well let's see-- Let's, okay, yeah, no, no, yeah, you do it. [__HARTRO:__ Yeah, you do it.] Let's see, let's see. Let's see what that Consultant heritage of yours, [__TREXEL:__ Thank you.] that *great* bloodline stretching back, that inexorable structure within which you exist, that allows nothing to change, and n-nothing, nothing to develop. Yes, yes, Consultant. Consult.

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's watch, let's watch this, this like, handed down to you when you were a baby, absolutely [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] never, never had to try for a day in your life, to be wheeled into a job of comfort for the rest of existence, that's, y'know, didn't deserve anything, but, look what your-- __[trails off]__

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* You trained from child. [__HARTRO:__ Hmm?] You trained from child for this.

#### HARTRO

Mmm.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Mocking Stellar Firma's inheritance-based management system is prohibited. However, in Trexel's case, I don't think can anyone argue that the system is perfect.

#### TREXEL

Well, I mean, thank you so much for your full-hearted supports. Let's go. Okay. Right. So.

#### HARTRO

Oh, I'm just gonna sit over here, in fact. I'm just gonna lay on this... __[collapses into soft furnishings]__ pouffe.

#### DAVID

Hey, and I'm, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna sit on the desk. I'm gonna sit on the desk, I'm gonna get-- Have you got any-- _(whispering)_ Have you go-- Have you got a pair of glasses?

#### HARTRO

Of course I do. Here you go. __[clatter of glasses unfolding]__

#### DAVID

I'm gonna just, I'm gonna just gonna perch them on the end of my nose. And I pop on the desk, but I cross my legs, and I'm gonna stare down you at them. What have you got, Geistman?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ If I were to guess, I would say that it is incoherent nonsense.

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, so, the brief is __[HARTRO:__ Hmm.] they wanted carpet cleaner, they've got cabernet. Oh, no. Well, how about this. Paradigm shift. Laser show! Uh, rave music! __[beatboxing poorly]__ A new experience from Geistman Enterprises, care of Stellar Firma! You thought you were a carpet cleaning company? Well, guess what, buddy: you're a bar now. __[bad beatboxing continues]__ Mystery wine tasting, from the Count's new corporeal bar! We've got cans of stuff that are mislabelled. It is a glass of cleaner? Is it a glass of the finest cabernet? It's a Russian Roulette of taste. Mmm, that's got a good robe, and a wonderful profile. Ow, that one's taken off of most of my skin.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Called it.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Laser show!

#### DAVID

Couple a-- Couple of notes.

#### HARTRO

Mm-hmm. Couple...

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Okay. I'm open to f-- I'm open to feedback.

#### DAVID

Okay, so first of all: 'bar' begins with 'b.' You could have gone with 'café,' you could have gone with 'club,' but it's a bar, fine.

#### HARTRO

Yeah, it's v-- *Obvious* they want 'c's.

#### DAVID

Second.

#### HARTRO

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

They've only got cabernet. They haven't got any carpet cleaner, otherwise this wouldn't be a problem. So where are they getting the carpet cleaner from?

#### TREXEL

No no no no no no no no no no, David, David, David, David, David, David, David, David, David, David, David, you're an idiot. They've got a delivery [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] of cabernet. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] What, do you think they're entirely out of carpet cleaner? They're a carpet cleaning business. One delivery does not a carpet cleaning business make. They've got a warehouse.

#### DAVID

Well, then why are they writing to us?

#### HARTRO

Yeah, why are they writing to us? They obvious--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* I dunno, I ass-- I assumed it's-- They were like, 'What do we do with all this cabernet?'

#### DAVID

Obv-- Well, obviously, their entire supply chain has been completely replaced by cabernet. It's cabernet all the way down.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Obviously? Obv-- Why obviously?

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ So there's absolutely no mystery.

#### TREXEL

Why obviously?

#### DAVID

'Cause they've commissioned Stellar Firma to consult. This isn't 'Oops, I've ended up with a warehouse full of cabernet.' They'll just drink it. Wouldn't you?

#### TREXEL

Well, I would, but I'm just aware that I'm not everyone, David. I'm not that conceited.

#### HARTRO

So basically, I, I, I buy my expensive tickets to go to the Four C Mystery Drinkathon, and--

#### DAVID

Well, the Three C and a B.

#### TREXEL

The Count's Corporeal Cabernet Clubhouse.

#### HARTRO

And guess what? [__DAVID:__ Better.] 'Oh! Cabernet. Ooh! Cabernet. Ooh! Cabernet. Hmm, the mystery seems to be that, hm, every drink is cabernet.'

#### TREXEL

No, no, no, but what I'm saying, __[burbles]__ they *must* have some __[Hartro hums doubtfully]__ knocking around somewhere. Maybe you squeeze it out of an old carpet. You take 'Ooh, cabernet, ooh, cabernet, oh no, I'm now dying, please inform the emergency services [__DAVID:__ Yeah, so that was--] because I've got a gut full of cleaner.'

#### DAVID

That was point three. The, th-the [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] the unique selling point of this clubhouse is that you might die.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ To be fair, that is also the unique selling point of life in general.

#### TREXEL

And you don't think that's attractive to people?

#### DAVID

Well, you might also die in a quite boring and painful way.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

You know, it's not like you're playing The Most Dangerous Game.

#### TREXEL

Well, you are playing the most dangerous game: Mystery Drink.

#### DAVID

Is that the most dangerous game? I thought--

#### TREXEL

Well, if we think about how many people have died over history. __[David mumbles]__ How many people have died, in history, because they drank something and it turned out they shouldn'ta? I think loads.

#### DAVID

I-In all, i-in, in all of space, you're n-- you're not, you're not black hole surfing, [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] you're not star marlin hunting, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] you, your mystery drinks is the most dangerous game.

##### [Hartro hums uncertainly]

#### TREXEL

In the same way--

#### DAVID

You're not even having a dinner party with the lead singer of the Winter Lettuce Collective.

#### TREXEL

In the same way, David, that on Old Earth, they concerned themselves an *enormous* amount of time about people in big, fancy rooms, playing card games, and then if they get something wrong they get taken to a back room and shot. And I mean, an *enormous* amount of time and effort was, was circled around these ideas. Films. Books. Uh, uh-- Roleplays. Everything was based around the idea that you're playing a game of cards, and then, and then someone shoots you because you got it wrong.

#### HARTRO

That was obviously because they had that giant eye in the sky that could just shoot a laser at you at any point.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ We've all saw how the Great Prophet Groshenko was laid low by hubris in the Temple of the Golden Eye.

#### TREXEL

Well, yes, we all know about the Giant Sky Laser from that one piece of footage that survived, but I don't think that was the only thing going on. I think it also had something to do with that weird badger-like thing that loved mashed potato. Which we're pretty sure was their Pope.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Everybody knows Pope Badger loves mashed potatoes.

#### HARTRO

I think there's a lot of 'I think's going on, Trexel. And, [__TREXEL:__ Well, I--] I don't think you can build a solution with 'I think'. Now--

#### TREXEL

Do you want to consult *The* *Big Book of Things We Think We Know About Earth*? I'm willing to consult it.

#### DAVID

Yeah, fine, let's consult *The Big Book of Things We Know About Earth*.

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* Let's do it.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* I'll get it out. __[burbles]__ Bring it up a copy here. __[computer screen whirrs up]__ Okay, so. Let's just, let's just take a few things we think we know about Earth, [__HARTRO:__ Let's do it.] [__DAVID:__ Okay.] and then put them against the idea that lots of people drank mystery fluids that killed them, and see which seems more reasonable, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.] shall we? Shall we? Shall we?

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Okay, okay.

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* Okay, and, and if it seems more reasonable, we'll send your solution, and if it doesn't, we'll send David's.

#### DAVID

A-Anything else, yeah.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Literally anything else at all, [__HARTRO:__ Alright.] it doesn't really matter. Okay. Fine, right, let's have a look here. Okay, okay, fine. There was an enormous man called "Big Ben" who yelled at you if you voted the wrong way. That seems weird.

#### HARTRO

Mmmm...

#### DAVID

Yeah, but how is that relevant to mystery drinks? He, he, he didn't force you to drink a mystery fluid if you voted the wrong way. He just shouted at you.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, good point, good, good... let's have, let's have a look at something else, let's have a look at something else. Okay! Okay, okay.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ I want f-- It needs to have a fluid, or mystery. Look under the 'm's. Look under the 'm's.

#### TREXEL

Okay, und-- For, for 'mystery'. Okay. Uhhh. Okay. Okay. There was one cavern in the middle of a continent called 'Ameriquoi?' that they called 'The Big Fancy Hole,' and nobody knew quite how it formed, except it was in the shape of a canyon. [__HARTRO:__ Hmm...] [__DAVID:__ Okay...] And so they assumed a canyon fell over, and crushed that shaped hole in the earth.

#### DAVID

Right...

#### HARTRO

Can you drink a canyon?

#### TREXEL

You can if it's full of can...yams... [__HARTRO:__ Hmm...] Which was the kind of fruit that grew in the canyon. A canyam.

#### DAVID

You're saying you can drink canyam juice...

#### HARTRO

From a canyon.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* We think so. But the mystery is how does it grow without the sunlight at the bottom of the canyon?

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* No-- After, after the, after the canyon falling down and creating, you know, the hole, [__HARTRO:__ Hmm.] [__TREXEL:__ Yes?] it all got a little bit improvisational there, Trexel. Are there canyams?

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* No, no, no, it's all written here. It's all written down here.

#### DAVID

Can I, can I see?

#### TREXEL

No, I-- No, I, I-- It's, it's just here. Th-There. Okay. So, there, yeah, you saw it there.

#### DAVID

C-Canyams don't exist, do they, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

No.

#### DAVID

You just made them up because, because you, you can see your argument crumbling in front of your eyes. Falling apart like out-of-date slurry.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Expected as it is, it is still so very embarrassing for you.

#### HARTRO

I'm just going to put a point up for David 7 there.

#### DAVID

I actually-- No, I think that was more of a self-sass. I think Trexel should just lose a point.

#### HARTRO

Yeah, 'cause you didn't really do the sassing, you just sort of pointe--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Canyams could be a thing.

#### DAVID

They could be. But they're not.

#### TREXEL

__[sighs]__ O-o-okay David, so looks like you've, you've beaten me in sass, you've beaten me in, in logic, you've, you've found out my canyam ruse. And that-- Fine, fine, let's just use something, y'know, just use anything else, because I suppose at this point, what's the point. Y'know, clearly Trexel doesn't know anything. Clearly Trexel isn't good enough to even merit consideration, so, you know--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, okay, but-- Well, hey, no-- But-- Look, no, no, no, but, but--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ No, no, no, fine, it doesn't matter, Trexel. It doesn't matter.

#### DAVID

No, but if we look at the--

#### TREXEL

Trexel doesn't matter, Trexel. Did-- Does he, Trexel? No, Trexel doesn't, [__DAVID:__ But--] does he? So why don't you just climb into a pit, and drink until your head falls off?

#### DAVID

Okay, but consider this: we don't really have time to do another one, so let's submit your idea.

#### HARTRO

What-- Trexel's one?

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Really?

#### DAVID

Well, yeah, 'cause, I mean, we, we-- I know we *literally* don't have time to write anything else. This is all we've got.

#### HARTRO

B-b-but--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* S-so, so we're using the cabernet club?

#### HARTRO

But if that follows the one that I did, they're gonna *know* something's weird, 'cause they're gonna be 'Oh, wow, it was so amazing, and... what, now, it's like this? And the discrepancy?'

##### [the room begins to rumble]

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* No-- Wh-- But--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Well, what do you want? Inconsistent, or not submitted on time, because we're getting a [__HARTRO:__ Ahh--] bit short on that.

#### DAVID

Also consider: this is Trexel. Wild inconsistency is the only consistent thing about him.

#### HARTRO

__[groans]__ You're right.

#### TREXEL

A win! Is a win!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Let's unload the slide ladder!

#### HARTRO

__[sighs]__ Actually, I do need to get rid of him, don't I.

#### DAVID

Yeah. I'm just gonna--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Submitting.

#### DAVID

There we go. Gone.

##### [pneumatic tube hisses, room rumbling stops as Hartro clicks button to deploy the ladder]

#### HARTRO

Slide ladder, here we go... there you go.

##### [Trexel makes childlike sounds of excitement as he runs to the ladder of the slide]

#### DAVID

Is there maybe an alternative track we can send him down?

#### HARTRO

Ooh, yes, I can reroute this thing! There we go.

##### [mechanical shifting]

#### TREXEL

_(distantly)_ Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

#### HARTRO

Right, David 7, I'm gonna push this somewhere where it's not gonna cause *too* much of a problem. __[chortles]__

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, see you tomorrow, Hartro!

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* Byyyyeeee! Good work!

#### DAVID

Byyyeee.

##### [door whooshes]

#### DAVID

_(to the slide as it is dragged away)_ And y-you, too. __[sighs contentedly]__ I'm the sassiest.
